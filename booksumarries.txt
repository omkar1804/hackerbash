When Major dies   two young pigs   Snowball and Napoleon   assume command and turn his dream into a philosophy. The animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible Mr Jones from the farm   renaming it ""Animal Farm"". They adopt Seven Commandments of Animal-ism   the most important of which is   ""All animals are equal"". Snowball attempts to teach the animals reading and writing; food is plentiful   and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items   ostensibly for their personal health. Napoleon takes the pups from the farm dogs and trains them privately. Napoleon and Snowball struggle for leadership. When Snowball announces his plans to build a windmill   Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away and declares himself leader. Napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm   replacing meetings with a committee of pigs   who will run the farm. Using a young pig named Squealer as a ""mouthpiece""   Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. After a violent storm   the animals find the windmill annihilated. Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball destroyed it   although the scorn of the neighbouring farmers suggests that its walls were too thin. Once Snowball becomes a scapegoat   Napoleon begins purging the farm with his dogs   killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival. He and the pigs abuse their power   imposing more control while reserving privileges for themselves and rewriting history   villainising Snowball and glorifying Napoleon. Squealer justifies every statement Napoleon makes   even the pigs' alteration of the Seven Commandments of Animalism to benefit themselves. 'Beasts of England' is replaced by an anthem glorifying Napoleon   who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man. The animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were when under Mr Jones. Squealer abuses the animals' poor memories and invents numbers to show their improvement. Mr Frederick   one of the neighbouring farmers   attacks the farm   using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill. Though the animals win the battle   they do so at great cost   as many   including Boxer the workhorse   are wounded. Despite his injuries   Boxer continues working harder and harder   until he collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to the veterinary surgeon's   explaining that better care can be given there. Benjamin   the cynical donkey   who ""could read as well as any pig""   notices that the van belongs to a knacker   and attempts to mount a rescue; but the animals' attempts are futile. Squealer reports that the van was purchased by the hospital and the writing from the previous owner had not been repainted. He recounts a tale of Boxer's death in the hands of the best medical care. Years pass   and the pigs learn to walk upright   carry whips and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are reduced to a single phrase: ""All animals are equal   but some animals are more equal than others"". Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and the humans of the area   who congratulate Napoleon on having the hardest-working but least fed animals in the country. Napoleon announces an alliance with the humans   against the labouring classes of both ""worlds"". He abolishes practices and traditions related to the Revolution   and changes the name of the farm to ""The Manor Farm"". The animals   overhearing the conversation   notice that the faces of the pigs have begun changing. During a poker match   an argument breaks out between Napoleon and Mr Pilkington   and the animals realise that the faces of the pigs look like the faces of humans   and no one can tell the difference between them. The pigs Snowball   Napoleon   and Squealer adapt Old Major's ideas into an actual philosophy   which they formally name Animalism. Soon after   Napoleon and Squealer indulge in the vices of humans (drinking alcohol   sleeping in beds   trading). Squealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation   an allusion to the Soviet government's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society. The original commandments are: # Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. # Whatever goes upon four legs   or has wings   is a friend. # No animal shall wear clothes. # No animal shall sleep in a bed. # No animal shall drink alcohol. # No animal shall kill any other animal. # All animals are equal. Later   Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear them of accusations of law-breaking (such as ""No animal shall drink alcohol"" having ""to excess"" appended to it and ""No animal shall sleep in a bed"" with ""with sheets"" added to it). The changed commandments are as follows   with the changes bolded: * 4 No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets. * 5 No animal shall drink alcohol to excess. * 6 No animal shall kill any other animal without cause. Eventually these are replaced with the maxims   ""All animals are equal   but some animals are more equal than others""   and ""Four legs good   two legs better!"" as the pigs become more human. This is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments   which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans   and prevent animals from following the humans' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments   Orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda."  13  "['Roman Ã  clef'   'Satire'   ""Children's literature""

Alex's friends (""droogs"" in the novel's Anglo-Russian slang   Nadsat) are: Dim   a slow-witted bruiser who is the gang's muscle; Georgie   an ambitious second-in-command; and Pete   who mostly plays along as the droogs indulge their taste for ultra-violence. Characterized as a sociopath and a hardened juvenile delinquent   Alex is also intelligent and quick-witted   with sophisticated taste in music   being particularly fond of Beethoven   or ""Lovely Ludwig Van."" The novel begins with the droogs sitting in their favorite hangout (the Korova Milkbar)   drinking milk-drug cocktails   called ""milk-plus""   to hype themselves for the night's mayhem. They assault a scholar walking home from the public library   rob a store leaving the owner and his wife bloodied and unconscious   stomp a panhandling derelict   then scuffle with a rival gang. Joyriding through the countryside in a stolen car   they break into an isolated cottage and maul the young couple living there   beating the husband and raping his wife. In a metafictional touch   the husband is a writer working on a manuscript called ""A Clockwork Orange  "" and Alex contemptuously reads out a paragraph that states the novel's main theme before shredding the manuscript. Back at the milk bar   Alex punishes Dim for some crude behaviour   and strains within the gang become apparent. At home in his dreary flat   Alex plays classical music at top volume while fantasizing of even more orgiastic violence. Alex skips school the next day. Following an unexpected visit from P.R. Deltoid   his ""post-corrective advisor  "" Alex meets a pair of ten-year-old girls and takes them back to his parents' flat   where he administers hard drugs and then rapes them. That evening   Alex finds his droogs in a mutinous mood. Georgie challenges Alex for leadership of the gang   demanding that they pull a ""man-sized"" job. Alex quells the rebellion by slashing Dim's hand and fighting with Georgie   then in a show of generosity takes them to a bar   where Alex insists on following through on Georgie's idea to burgle the home of a wealthy old woman. The break-in starts as farce and ends in tragic pathos   as Alex's attack kills the elderly woman. His escape is blocked by Dim   who attacks Alex   leaving him incapacitated on the front step as the police arrive. Sentenced to prison for murder   Alex gets a job at the Wing chapel playing religious music on the stereo before and after services as well as during the singing of hymns. The prison chaplain mistakes Alex's Bible studies for stirrings of faith (Alex is actually reading Scripture for the violent passages). After Alex's fellow cellmates blame him for beating a troublesome cellmate to death   he agrees to undergo an experimental behaviour-modification treatment called the Ludovico Technique. The technique is a form of aversion therapy in which Alex receives an injection that makes him feel sick while watching graphically violent films   eventually conditioning him to suffer crippling bouts of nausea at the mere thought of violence. As an unintended consequence   the soundtrack to one of the filmsâBeethoven's Fifth Symphonyârenders Alex unable to listen to his beloved classical music. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated to a group of VIPs   who watch as Alex collapses before a walloping bully   and abases himself before a scantily-clad young woman whose presence has aroused his predatory sexual inclinations. Though the prison chaplain accuses the state of stripping Alex of free will   the government officials on the scene are pleased with the results and Alex is released into society. Since his parents are now renting his room to a lodger   Alex wanders the streets and enters a public library where he hopes to learn a painless way to commit suicide. There   he accidentally encounters the old scholar he assaulted earlier in the book   who   keen on revenge   beats Alex with the help of his friends. The policemen who come to Alex's rescue turn out to be none other than Dim and former gang rival Billyboy. The two policemen take Alex outside of town and beat him up. Dazed and bloodied   Alex collapses at the door of an isolated cottage   realizing too late that it is the house he and his droogs invaded in the first half of the story. Because the gang wore masks during the assault   the writer does not recognize Alex. The writer   whose name is revealed as F. Alexander   shelters Alex and questions him about the conditioning. During this sequence   it is revealed that Mrs. Alexander died from the injuries inflicted during the gang-rape   and her husband has decided to continue living ""where her fragrant memory persists"" despite the horrid memories. Alexander   a critic of the government   hopes to use Alex as a symbol of state brutality and thereby prevent the incumbent government from being re-elected. Eventually   he begins to realize Alex's role in the happenings of the night two years ago. One of Alexander's radical associates manages to extract a confession from Alex after removing him from F. Alexander's home and then locks him in a flatblock near his former home. Alex is then subjected to a relentless barrage of classical music   prompting him to attempt suicide by leaping from a high window. Alex wakes up in hospital   where he is courted by government officials anxious to counter the bad publicity created by his suicide attempt. With Alexander safely packed off to a mental institution   Alex is offered a well-paying job if he agrees to side with the government. As photographers snap pictures   Alex daydreams of orgiastic violence and realizes the Ludovico conditioning has been reversed: ""I was cured all right."" In the final chapter   Alex has a new trio of droogs   but he finds he is beginning to outgrow his taste for violence. A chance encounter with Pete   now married and settled down   inspires Alex to seek a wife and family of his own. He contemplates the likelihood of his future son being a delinquent as he was   a prospect Alex views fatalistically."  6  "['Science Fiction'   'Novella'   'Speculative fiction'   'Utopian and

2  3  986  The Plague  Albert Camus  "{""/m/02m4t"": ""Existentialism""   ""/m/02xlf"": ""Fiction""   ""/m/0pym5"": ""Absurdist fiction""   ""/m/05hgj"": ""Novel""}"  " The text of The Plague is divided into five parts. In the town of Oran   thousands of rats   initially unnoticed by the populace   begin to die in the streets. A hysteria develops soon afterward   causing the local newspapers to report the incident. Authorities responding to public pressure order the collection and cremation of the rats   unaware that the collection itself was the catalyst for the spread of the bubonic plague. The main character   Dr. Bernard Rieux   lives comfortably in an apartment building when strangely the building's concierge   M. Michel   a confidante   dies from a fever. Dr. Rieux consults his colleague   Castel   about the illness until they come to the conclusion that a plague is sweeping the town. They both approach fellow doctors and town authorities about their theory   but are eventually dismissed on the basis of one death. However   as more and more deaths quickly ensue   it becomes apparent that there is an epidemic. Authorities   including the Prefect   M. Othon   are slow to accept that the situation is serious and quibble over the appropriate action to take. Official notices enacting control measures are posted   but the language used is optimistic and downplays the seriousness of the situation. A ""special ward"" is opened at the hospital   but its 80 beds are filled within three days. As the death toll begins to rise   more desperate measures are taken. Homes are quarantined; corpses and burials are strictly supervised. A supply of plague serum finally arrives   but there is only enough to treat existing cases and the country's emergency reserves are depleted. When the daily number of deaths jumps to 30   the town is sealed and an outbreak of plague is officially declared. The town is sealed off. The town gates are shut   rail travel is prohibited   and all mail service is suspended. The use of telephone lines is restricted only to ""urgent"" calls   leaving short telegrams as the only means of communicating with friends or family outside the town. The separation affects daily activity and depresses the spirit of the townspeople   who begin to feel isolated and introverted   and the plague begins to affect various characters. One character   Raymond Rambert   devises a plan to escape the city to join his lover in Paris after city officials refuse his request to leave. He befriends some criminals so that they may smuggle him out of the city. Another character   Father Paneloux   uses the plague as an opportunity to advance his stature in the town by suggesting that the plague was an act of God punishing the citizens' sinful nature. His diatribe falls on the ears of many citizens of the town   who turned to religion in droves but would not have done so under normal circumstances. Cottard   a criminal remorseful enough to attempt suicide yet fearful of being arrested   becomes wealthy as a major smuggler. Meanwhile   Dr. Rieux   a vacationer Jean Tarrou   and a civil servant Joseph Grand exhaustively treat patients in their homes and in the hospital. Rambert informs Tarrou of his escape plan   but when Tarrou tells him that others in the city   including Dr. Rieux   also have loved ones outside the city whom they are not allowed to see   Rambert becomes sympathetic and changes his mind. He then decides to join Tarrou and Dr. Rieux to help fight the epidemic. In mid-August   the situation continues to worsen. People try to escape the town   but some are shot by armed sentries. Violence and looting break out on a small scale   and the authorities respond by declaring martial law and imposing a curfew. Funerals are conducted with more and more speed   no ceremony   and little concern for the feelings of the families of the deceased. The inhabitants passively endure their increasing feelings of exile and separation; despondent   they waste away emotionally as well as physically. In September and October   the town remains at the mercy of the plague. Rieux hears from the sanatorium that his wife's condition is worsening. He also hardens his heart regarding the plague victims so that he can continue to do his work. Cottard   on the other hand   seems to flourish during the plague   because it gives him a sense of being connected to others   since everybody faces the same danger. Cottard and Tarrou attend a performance of Gluck's opera Orpheus and Eurydice   but the actor portraying Orpheus collapses with plague symptoms during the performance. Rambert finally has a chance to escape   but he decides to stay   saying that he would feel ashamed of himself if he left. Towards the end of October   Castel's new anti-plague serum is tried for the first time   but it cannot save the life of Othon's young son   who suffers greatly   as Paneloux   Rieux   and Tarrou look on in horror. Paneloux   who has joined the group of volunteers fighting the plague   gives a second sermon. He addresses the problem of an innocent child's suffering and says it is a test of a Christian's faith   since it requires him either to deny everything or believe everything. He urges the congregation not to give up the struggle but to do everything possible to fight the plague. A few days after the sermon   Paneloux is taken ill. His symptoms do not conform to those of the plague   but the disease still proves fatal. Tarrou and Rambert visit one of the isolation camps   where they meet Othon. When Othon's period of quarantine ends   he elects to stay in the camp as a volunteer because this will make him feel less separated from his dead son. Tarrou tells Rieux the story of his life   and the two men go swimming together in the sea. Grand catches the plague and instructs Rieux to burn all his papers. But Grand makes an unexpected recovery   and deaths from the plague start to decline. By late January   the plague is in full retreat   and the townspeople begin to celebrate the imminent opening of the town gates. Othon   however   does not escape death from the disease. Cottard is distressed by the ending of the epidemic   from which he has profited by shady dealings. Two government employees approach him   and he flees. Despite the epidemic's ending   Tarrou contracts the plague and dies after an heroic struggle. Rieux's wife also dies. In February   the town gates open and people are reunited with their loved ones from other cities. Rambert is reunited with his wife. Rieux reveals that he is the narrator of the chronicle and that he tried to present an objective view of the events. Cottard goes mad and shoots at people from his home. He is arrested. Grand begins working on his sentence again. Rieux reflects on the epidemic and reaches the conclusion that there is more to admire than to despise in humans."  17  "['Existentialism'   'Fiction'   'Absurdist fiction'   'Novel']"  the text of

The innermost   the ""Unthinking Depths""   surrounds the galactic core and is incapable of supporting advanced life forms at all. The next layer   the ""Slow Zone""   is roughly equivalent to the real world in behavior and potential. Further out   the zone named the ""Beyond"" can support futuristic technologies such as AI and FTL travel. The outermost zone   the ""Transcend""   contains most of the galactic halo and is populated by incomprehensibly vast and powerful posthuman entities. A human expedition investigates a five-billion-year-old data archive that offers the possibility of unimaginable riches for the ambitious young civilization of the Straumli Realm. The expedition's facility   called High Lab   is gradually compromised by a dormant super-intelligent entity (actually encoded within the archive) later known as the Blight. The Blight rapidly learns how to infiltrate and control the computer systems of High Lab   and even develops the ability to possess and control the living humans. The novel starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of this superintelligence through exponentially accelerating developmental stages   culminating in a transcendent   nigh-omnipotent power that is unfathomable to mere humans. Shortly before its final ""flowering""   the changes in a single minute of the Blight's life are said to exceed those of 10  000 years of human civilization. Recognizing the danger of what they have awakened   the researchers at High Lab attempt to flee in two ships. Suspicious   the Blight discovers that one of the ships contains a data storage device in its cargo manifest; assuming it contains information that could harm it   the Blight destroys the ship. The second ship is allowed to escape   unharmed   as the Blight assumes that it is no threat; but later realizes that it actually held a countermeasure   one of the few things in the universe that the Blight fears. The ship lands on a distant planet with a medieval-level civilization of dog-like creatures dubbed ""Tines""   who live in packs as group minds. The ship is revealed to be a sleeper ship   carrying most of High Lab's children in ""coldsleep boxes"". The boxes are rapidly failing and the surviving adults begin unloading them   but are killed when one of two rival forces of Tines seize the ship. The faction that initially contacts the humans   led by a Tine known as Steel   kills the adults and destroys many of the coldsleep boxes. They also capture a boy named Jefri Olsndot   whom Steel intended on killing but eventually exploits in order to develop advanced technology (such as cannon and radio communication). Jefri's older sister   Johanna   is rescued by Pilgrim and Scriber   wandering Tines who bring her to the rival faction   led by Woodcarver. She is asked to help develop technology that could gain the upper hand in the impending war. A distress signal from the sleeper ship eventually reaches ""Relay""   a major node in the galactic communications network. A benign transcendent entity (known as a ""Power"") named ""Old One"" contacts Relay   seeking information about the Blight and the humans who released it. Old One constructs a seemingly human man   Pham Nuwen   to act as its agent. Pham and Ravna Bergsndot â a human employee of Relay's owners   the wealthy Vrinimi Organization â trace the sleeper ship's signal to the Tines world. Old One designs a vessel   the Out of Band II   to reach the Tines world and to investigate what the ship carried with it from the High Lab. The Blight attacks Relay and Old One. Old One gives Pham the information necessary to activate the Blight Countermeasure while dying (a process known as godshatter)   and Pham and Ravna escape Relay's destruction in the Out of Band II. After arriving at the Tines homeworld and allying with Woodcarver to defeat Steel   Pham initiates the Countermeasure   which extends the Slow Zone by thousands of light-years to enclose the Blight. This ends the threat of the Blight at the cost of wrecking thousands of uninvolved civilizations   causing trillions of deaths and potentially the extinction of several galactic races. The process also kills Pham and strands the other humans on the Tines world   now in the depths of the ""Slow Zone"" where rescue by an advanced civilization is impossible."  9  "['Hard science

5  6  2152  All Quiet on the Western Front  Erich Maria Remarque  "{""/m/098tmk"": ""War novel""   ""/m/016lj8"": ""Roman \u00e0 clef""}"  " The book tells the story of Paul BÃ¤umer   a German soldier whoâurged on by his school teacherâjoins the German army shortly after the start of World War I. BÃ¤umer arrives at the Western Front with his friends and schoolmates (Tjaden   MÃ¼ller   Kropp and a number of other characters). There they meet Stanislaus Katczinsky   an older soldier   nicknamed Kat   who becomes Paul's mentor. While fighting at the front   BÃ¤umer and his comrades have to engage in frequent battles and endure the dangerous and often dirty conditions of warfare. At the very beginning of the book Erich Maria Remarque says ""This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession   and least of all an adventure   for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who   even though they may have escaped shells   were destroyed by the war."" The book does not focus on heroic stories of bravery   but rather gives a view of the conditions in which the soldiers find themselves. The monotony between battles   the constant threat of artillery fire and bombardments   the struggle to find food   the lack of training of young recruits (meaning lower chances of survival)   and the overarching role of random chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers are described in detail. The battles fought here have no names and seem to have little overall significance   except for the impending possibility of injury or death for BÃ¤umer and his comrades. Only pitifully small pieces of land are gained   about the size of a football field   which are often lost again later. Remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead   emotionally drained and shaken. ""We are not youth any longer. We don't want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing from ourselves   from our life. We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces."" Paul's visit on leave to his home highlights the cost of the war on his psyche. The town has not changed since he went off to war; however   he finds that he does ""not belong here anymore   it is a foreign world."" He feels disconnected from most of the townspeople. His father asks him ""stupid and distressing"" questions about his war experiences   not understanding ""that a man cannot talk of such things."" An old schoolmaster lectures him about strategy and advancing to Paris   while insisting that Paul and his friends know only their ""own little sector"" of the war but nothing of the big picture. Indeed   the only person he remains connected to is his dying mother   with whom he shares a tender   yet restrained relationship. The night before he is to return from leave   he stays up with her   exchanging small expressions of love and concern for each other. He thinks to himself   ""Ah! Mother   Mother! How can it be that I must part from you? Here I sit and there you are lying; we have so much to say   and we shall never say it."" In the end   he concludes that he ""ought never to have come [home] on leave."" Paul feels glad to be reunited with his comrades. Soon after   he volunteers to go on a patrol and kills a man for the first time in hand-to-hand combat. He watches the man die   in pain for hours. He feels remorse and asks forgiveness from the man's corpse. He is devastated and later confesses to Kat and Albert   who try to comfort him and reassure him that it is only part of the war. They are then sent on what Paul calls a ""good job."" They must guard a village that is being shelled too heavily. The men enjoy themselves but while evacuating the villagers   Paul and Albert are wounded. They recuperate in a Catholic hospital and Paul returns to active duty. By now   the war is nearing its end and the German Army is retreating. In despair   Paul watches as his friends fall one by one. It is the death of Kat that eventually makes Paul careless about living. In the final chapter   he comments that peace is coming soon   but he does not see the future as bright and shining with hope. Paul feels that he has no aims left in life and that their generation will be different and misunderstood. When he finally dies at the end of the novel   the situation report from the frontline states   ""All is Quiet on the Western Front  "" symbolizing the cheapness of human life in war."  6  "['War

world war i b umer arrives at the western front with his friends and schoolmates tjaden m ller kropp and a number of other characters there they meet stanislaus katczinsky an older soldier nicknamed kat who becomes pauls mentor while fighting at the front b umer and his comrades have to engage in frequent battles and endure the dangerous and often dirty conditions of warfare at the very beginning of the book erich maria remarque says this book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession and least of all an adventure for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it it will try simply to tell of a generation of men who even though they may have escaped shells were destroyed by the war the book does not focus on heroic stories of bravery but rather gives a view of the conditions in which the soldiers find themselves the monotony between battles the constant threat of artillery fire and bombardments the struggle to find food the lack of training of young recruits meaning lower chances of survival and the overarching role of random chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers are described in detail the battles fought here have no names and seem to have little overall significance except for the impending possibility of injury or death for b umer and his comrades only pitifully small pieces of land are gained about the size of a football field which are often lost again later remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead emotionally drained and shaken we are not youth any longer we dont want to take the world by storm we are fleeing from ourselves from our life we were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world and we had to shoot it to pieces pauls visit on leave to his home highlights the cost of the war on his

His mother is dead   his much older siblings have all left home   and his father is a dour   taciturn bronzesmith with nothing in common with his son   so the boy grows up wild and headstrong. Ged discovers by accident that he has an extraordinary talent for magic. His aunt   the village witch   teaches him the little she herself knows   but his power far exceeds hers. One day   he uses his talent and a fog-gathering spell he learned from a passing weatherworker to save his village from Karg raiders. The tale of his remarkable feat spreads far and wide   finally reaching the ear of a wise Gontish mage   Ogion the Silent. He recognizes that the boy is so powerful he must be trained so as not to become a danger to himself and others. In the rite of passage into adulthood   he gives the boy his ""true name""   Ged   and takes him as an apprentice. In this world   a magician who knows someone's true name has control over that person   so one's true name is revealed only to those whom one trusts completely. Normally   a person is referred to by his or her ""use name"". Ged's is Sparrowhawk. The undisciplined young man grows restless under the gentle   patient tutelage of his master. One day   at the taunting of the daughter of the local lord - who   it is later revealed   is also a witch - Ged seeks a powerful spell from one of Ogion's old books to impress the girl. As he reads the spell   to his horror   a shadowy being manifests. The shade advances on Ged   but is driven away by the timely return of Ogion. Ogion finally gives him a choice: stay with him or go to the renowned school for wizards   on the island of Roke. Though he has grown to love the old man   the youngster is drawn irresistibly to a life of doing   rather than being. At the school   Ged masters his craft with ease   but his pride and arrogance grow even faster than his skill and   in his hubris   he attempts to summon a dead spirit - a perilous spell which goes awry. The shadow seizes the chance to escape into the world and attacks him   scarring his face. It is driven off by the head of the school   the Archmage Nemmerle   who expends all of his power in the process and dies shortly thereafter. Ged is wracked with guilt at causing the old man's death   but after a painful and slow recovery   he graduates from the school. Normally   Roke's wizards are much sought after by princes and rich merchants   but the new Archmage sends a willing Ged to a poor island group instead   to protect the inhabitants from a powerful dragon and its maturing sons   who have been seen scouting the region. Ged eventually realizes that he cannot both defend the islanders against the dragon and himself against the nameless thing he summoned into the world. He takes a desperate gamble; in the old histories   he has found the true name of a dragon which might be the one he faces. His guess is right and by using the dragon's name   Yevaud   he is able to force the dragon to vow that neither it nor its offspring will ever trouble the islanders. Then   with no idea how to deal with his other foe   Ged tries to return to the safety of Roke   but the magical   protective Mage-wind drives away the ship on which he is a passenger. On the far northern island of Osskil   his nemesis takes possession of a man and nearly catches him. Ged flees to what appears to be a safe haven in the castle of Benderesk   the lord of Terranon. Serret   his wife   is the same girl who taunted Ged years ago. She tries to enslave Ged using the power of a stone which harbors one of the ""Nameless Ones""   ancient malevolent powers that predate people. Fortunately Ged realizes his peril just in time and flies away in the form of a falcon. He instinctively returns to Gont and Ogion   who advises him to turn the tables on his shadow. In following his master's wise guidance   the roles of Ged and his enemy become reversed   and the shadow becomes the hunted. Ged pursues the shadow southwards across the ocean   but is nearly drowned when the shadow lures him into steering his boat onto rocks. The vessel sinks   but he manages to reach a small island inhabited by only two old people   a Kargish man and his sister   who were abandoned there as children and who have forgotten there is an outside world and other people. Despite their initial fear of him   they provide him with food and water. After Ged regains his strength   he constructs another boat. When he is ready to leave   he offers to take the pair wherever they want to go   but the man fearfully turns him down   and the woman does not seem to understand what he means. However   she gives him a parting gift of one of her few possessions   a broken half of an armlet. (The siblings' story and the gift's significance are revealed in the sequel   The Tombs of Atuan.) Back at sea   the shadow nearly takes Ged unawares   but he senses it just in time and comes to grips with it   forging a bond that cannot be broken. Ged follows the shadow south. On the island of Iffish   his luck begins to improve. The resident wizard is Vetch (true name Estarriol)   the only friend he made at school. Estarriol insists on accompanying him. The two wizards eventually leave behind the last known island of Earthsea and head out into the open sea. As they draw closer to the shadow   Ged perceives the water gradually congealing and turning into land   an immensely powerful magic. Though Vetch cannot see the transformation   the boat runs aground. Ged steps out of the boat and walks off to confront his waiting shadow. Though some of his teachers had thought it to be nameless   Ged and his adversary speak at the same moment   each naming the other ""Ged"". The two embrace and become one. The sea returns to its normal state; fortunately   Estarriol is able to fish his healed friend out of the water."  12  "[""Children's literature""   'Fantasy'   'Speculative fiction'   'Bildungsroman'

He is approached by a woman who explains she is Sarah Tyrell   niece of Eldon Tyrell   heiress to the entire Tyrell Corporation and the human template (templant) for the Rachael replicant. She asks Deckard to hunt down the ""missing"" sixth replicant. At the same time   the human template for Roy Batty hires Dave Holden   the blade runner attacked by Leon   to help him hunt down the man he believes is the sixth replicant - Deckard. Deckard and Holden's investigations lead them to re-visit Sebastian   Bryant   and John Isidore (from the book Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?)   learning more about the nature of the blade runners and the replicants. When Deckard   Batty   and Holden finally clash   Batty's inhuman fighting prowess leads Holden to believe he has been duped all along and that Batty is the sixth replicant; he shoots him. Deckard returns to Sarah with his suspicion: there is no sixth replicant. Sarah   speaking via a remote camera   confesses that she created and maintained the rumor herself   to deliberately discredit and eventually destroy the Tyrell Corporation   after her uncle Eldon created Rachael based on her and then abandoned the real Sarah. Sarah brings Rachael back to the Corporation building to meet with Deckard   and he escapes with her. However   Holden - recovering from his injuries during the fight - later finds the truth: Rachael has been killed by Tyrell agents   and the ""Rachael"" who escaped with Deckard was actually Sarah.

15  16  4386  Book of Job    "{""/m/02mdj1"": ""Religious text""}"  " The book of Job tells the story of an extremely righteous man named Job   who is very prosperous and has seven sons and three daughters. Constantly fearing that his sons may have sinned and ""cursed God in their hearts""   he habitually offers burnt offerings as a pardon for their sins. The ""sons of God"" and Satan (literally ""the Adversary"") present themselves to God   and God asks Satan his opinion on Job. Satan answers that Job is pious only because God has put a ""wall around"" him and ""blessed"" his favourite servant with prosperity   but if God were to stretch out his hand and strike everything that Job had   then he would surely curse God. God gives Satan permission to test Job's righteousness. All Job's possessions are destroyed: 500 yoke of oxen and 500 donkeys carried off by Sabeans; 7  000 sheep burned up by 'The fire of God which fell from the sky'; 3  000 camels stolen by the Chaldeans; and the house of the firstborn destroyed by a mighty wind   killing Job's ten children. Still Job does not curse God   but instead shaves his head   tears his clothes   and says   ""Naked I came out of my mother's womb   and naked shall I return: Lord has given   and Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of Lord."" As Job endures these calamities without reproaching God   Satan solicits permission to afflict his person as well   and God says   ""Behold   he is in your hand   but don't touch his life."" Satan   therefore   smites him with dreadful boils   and Job   seated in ashes   scrapes his skin with broken pottery. His wife prompts him to ""curse God   and die  "" but Job answers   ""You speak as one of the foolish speaks. Moreover   shall we receive good from God and shall not receive evil?"" Three friends of Job   Eliphaz the Temanite   Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite   come to console him. (A fourth   Elihu the Buzite (Heb: Alieua ben Barakal the Buzite)   begins talking in Chapter 32 and plays a significant role in the dialogue   but his arrival is not described.) The friends spend seven days sitting on the ground with Job   without saying anything to him because they see that he is suffering and in much pain. Job at last breaks his silence and ""curses the day he was born."" God responds saying that there are so many things Job does not know about how this world was formed or how nature works   that Job should consider God as being greater than the thunderstorm and strong enough to pull in the leviathan with a fish-hook. God then rebukes the three friends and says   ""I am angry with you... you have not spoken of me what is right.""

A new religious figure called ""The Preacher"" has risen in the desert   railing against the religious government's injustices and the changes among the Fremen. Some Fremen believe he is Paul Atreides. The fallen House Corrino on Salusa Secundus plots to assassinate the twins and regain power. Lady Jessica returns to Arrakis and recognizes that her daughter has been possessed but finds no signs of abomination in the twins. She plans with them to thwart Alia's plotting.

22  23  6629  "Candide   ou l'Optimisme"  Voltaire  "{""/m/06nbt"": ""Satire""   ""/m/01jym"": ""Bildungsroman""   ""/m/0g_jj"": ""Picaresque novel""}"  " Candide contains thirty episodic chapters   which may be grouped into two main schemes: one consists of two divisions   separated by the protagonist's hiatus in El Dorado; the other consists of three parts   each defined by its geographical setting. By the former scheme   the first half of Candide constitutes the rising action and the last part the resolution. This view is supported by the strong theme of travel and quest   reminiscent of adventure and picaresque novels   which tend to employ such a dramatic structure. By the latter scheme   the thirty chapters may be grouped into three parts each comprising ten chapters and defined by locale: IâX are set in Europe   XIâXX are set in the Americas   and XXIâXXX are set in Europe and the Ottoman Empire. The plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes Voltaire's additions of 1761. The tale of Candide begins in the castle of the Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh in Westphalia   home to the Baron's daughter   Lady CunÃ©gonde; his bastard nephew   Candide; a tutor   Pangloss; a chambermaid   Paquette; and the rest of the Baron's family. The protagonist   Candide   is romantically attracted to CunÃ©gonde. He is a child of ""the most unaffected simplicity""   whose face is ""the index of his mind"". Dr. Pangloss   professor of ""mÃ©taphysico-thÃ©ologo-cosmolonigologie"" (english translation ""metaphysico-theologo-cosmonigology"") and self-proclaimed optimist   teaches his pupils that they live in the ""best of all possible worlds"" and that ""all is for the best"". All is well in the castle until CunÃ©gonde sees Pangloss sexually engaged with Paquette in some bushes. Encouraged by this show of affection   CunÃ©gonde drops her handkerchief next to Candide which entices him to kiss her. For this infraction   Candide is evicted from the castle   at which point he is captured by Bulgar (Prussian) recruiters and coerced into military service   where he is flogged   nearly executed   and forced to participate in a major battle between the Bulgars and the Abares (an allegory representing the Prussians and the French). Candide eventually escapes the army and makes his way to Holland where he is given aid by Jacques   an Anabaptist   who strengthens Candide's optimism. Soon after   Candide finds his master Pangloss   now a beggar with syphilis. Pangloss reveals he was infected with this disease by Paquette and shocks Candide by relating how Castle Thunder-ten-Tronckh was destroyed by Bulgars   and that CunÃ©gonde and her whole family were killed. Pangloss is cured of his illness by Jacques   losing one eye and one ear in the process   and the three set sail to Lisbon. In Lisbon's harbor   they are overtaken by a vicious storm which destroys the boat. Jacques attempts to save a sailor   and in the process is thrown overboard. The sailor makes no move to help the drowning Jacques   and Candide is in a state of despair until Pangloss explains to him that Lisbon harbor was created in order for Jacques to drown. Only Pangloss   Candide   and the ""brutish sailor"" who let Jacques drown survive the wreck and reach Lisbon   which is promptly hit by an earthquake   tsunami and fire which kill tens of thousands. The sailor leaves in order to loot the rubble while Candide   injured and begging for help   is lectured on the optimistic view of the situation by Pangloss. The next day   Pangloss discusses his optimistic philosophy with a member of the Portuguese Inquisition   and he and Candide are arrested for heresy   set to be tortured and killed in an ""auto-da-fÃ©"" set up to appease God and prevent another disaster. Candide is flogged and sees Pangloss hanged   but another earthquake intervenes and he escapes. He is approached by an old woman   who leads him to a house where Lady CunÃ©gonde waits   alive. Candide is surprised: Pangloss had told him that CunÃ©gonde had been raped and disemboweled. She had been   but CunÃ©gonde points out that people survive such things. However   her rescuer sold her to a Jewish merchant who was then threatened by a corrupt Grand Inquisitor into sharing her. Her owners arrive   find her with another man   and Candide kills them both. Candide and the two women flee the city   heading to the Americas. Along the way   CunÃ©gonde falls into self-pity   complaining of all the misfortunes that have befallen her. The old woman reciprocates by revealing her own tragic life   which included having a buttock cut off in order to feed some starving men. The trio arrives in Buenos Aires   where Governor Don Fernando d'Ibarra   y Figueroa   y Mascarenes   y Lampourdos   y Alejandro asks to marry CunÃ©gonde. Just then   an alcalde (a Portuguese fortress commander) arrives   pursuing Candide for killing the Grand Inquisitor. Leaving the women behind   Candide flees to Paraguay with his practical and heretofore unmentioned manservant   Cacambo. At a border post on the way to Paraguay   Cacambo and Candide speak to the commandant   who turns out to be CunÃ©gonde's unnamed brother. He explains that after his family was slaughtered   the Jesuits' preparation for his burial revived him   and he has since joined the order. When Candide proclaims he intends to marry CunÃ©gonde   her brother attacks him   and Candide stabs him through with his rapier. After lamenting all the people (mainly priests) he's killed   he and Cacambo flee. In their flight   Candide and Cacambo come across two naked women being chased and bitten by a pair of monkeys. Candide   seeking to protect the women   shoots and kills the monkeys   but is informed by Cacambo that the monkeys and women were probably lovers. Cacambo and Candide are captured by Oreillons   the fictional inhabitants of the area. Mistaking Candide for a Jesuit by his robes   the Oreillons prepare to cook Candide and Cacambo; however   Cacambo convinces the Oreillons that Candide killed a Jesuit to procure the robe. Cacambo and Candide are released and travel for a month on foot and then down a river by canoe   living on fruits and berries. After a few more adventures   Candide and Cacambo wander into El Dorado   a geographically isolated utopia where the streets are covered with precious stones   there exist no priests   and all of the king's jokes are funny. Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado   but Candide is still in pain without CunÃ©gonde   and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish idea   but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey   now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money   which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures. Candide and Cacambo eventually reach Suriname   where they split up: Cacambo travels to Buenos Aires to retrieve Lady CunÃ©gonde   while Candide prepares to travel to Europe to await the two. Candide's remaining sheep are stolen   and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft. Before leaving Surinam   Candide feels in need of companionship   so he interviews a number of local men who have been through various ill-fortunes and settles on a man named Martin. This companion   Martin   is a Manichean scholar based on the real-life pessimist Pierre Bayle   who was a chief opponent of Leibniz. For the remainder of the voyage   Martin and Candide argue about philosophy   Martin painting the entire world as occupied by fools. Candide   however   remains an optimist at heart   since it is all he knows. As they arrive in England   they see an admiral (based on Admiral Byng) being shot for not killing enough of the enemy. Martin explains that Britain finds it necessary to shoot an admiral from time to time ""pour l'encouragement des autres"" (to encourage the others). Candide   horrified   arranges for them to leave Britain immediately. After various scenes satirising other European institutions   Candide and Martin meet Paquette   the chambermaid who infected Pangloss with his syphilis   in Venice. She is now a prostitute   and is spending her time with a monk   Brother GiroflÃ©e. Although both appear happy on the surface   they reveal their despair: Paquette has led a miserable existence as a sexual object   and the monk detests the religious order in which he was indoctrinated. Later   while Candide and Martin are eating supper   Cacambo returns to Candide and informs him that CunÃ©gonde is in Constantinople   and that she has been enslaved. She is now washing dishes for a prince of Transylvania   and has become ugly. On the way to rescue her   Candide finds Pangloss and CunÃ©gonde's brother rowing in the galley. Candide buys their freedom and further passage at steep prices. The baron and Pangloss relate how they survived   but despite the horrors he has been through   Pangloss's optimism remains unshaken: ""I still hold to my original opinions   because   after all   I'm a philosopher   and it wouldn't be proper for me to recant   since Leibniz cannot be wrong   and since pre-established harmony is the most beautiful thing in the world   along with the plenum and subtle matter."" The travellers arrive on the Ottoman coast where they rejoin CunÃ©gonde and the old woman. CunÃ©gonde has indeed become hideously ugly   but Candide nevertheless buys their freedom and marries CunÃ©gonde to spite her brother. Paquette and Brother GiroflÃ©e   too   are reconciled with Candide on a farm which he just bought with the last of his finances. One day   the protagonists seek out a dervish known as a great philosopher of the land. Pangloss asks him why Man is made to suffer so   and what they all ought to do. The dervish responds by asking rhetorically why Pangloss is concerned about the existence of evil and good. The dervish describes human beings as mice on a ship sent by a king to Egypt; their comfort does not matter to the king. The dervish then slams his door on the group. Returning to their farm   Candide   Pangloss   and Martin meet a Turk whose philosophy is to devote his life only to simple work and not concern himself with external affairs. He and his four children work a small farm to keep ""free of three great evils: boredom   vice and necessity""   or ""poverty"" as per John Butt's 1947 translation. Candide   Pangloss   Martin   CunÃ©gonde   Paquette   Cacambo   the old woman   and Brother GiroflÃ©e all set to work (on this ""louable dessein""   or ""commendable plan""   as the narrator calls it)   each to one specific task. Candide ignores Pangloss's insistence that all turned out for the best by necessity   instead telling him ""we must cultivate our garden""."  14  "['Satire'   'Bildungsroman'   'Picaresque novel']"

The Matres are seeking to assimilate the technology and developed methods of the Bene Gesserit and exterminate the Sisterhood itself. Now in command of the Bene Gesserit   Mother Superior Darwi Odrade continues to develop her drastic   secret plan to overcome the Honored Matres. The Bene Gesserit are also terraforming the planet Chapterhouse to accommodate the all-important sandworms   whose native planet Dune had been destroyed by the Matres. Sheeana   in charge of the project   expects sandworms to appear soon. The Honored Matres have also destroyed the entire Bene Tleilax civilization   with Tleilaxu Master Scytale the only one of his kind left alive. In Bene Gesserit captivity   Scytale possesses the Tleilaxu secret of ghola production   which he has reluctantly traded for the Sisterhood's protection. The first ghola produced is that of their recently-deceased military genius   Miles Teg. The Bene Gesserit have two other prisoners on Chapterhouse: the latest Duncan Idaho ghola   and former Honored Matre Murbella   whom they have accepted as a novice despite their suspicion that she intends to escape back to the Honored Matres. Lampadas   a center for Bene Gesserit education   has been destroyed by the Honored Matres. The planet's Chancellor   Reverend Mother Lucilla   manages to escape carrying the shared-minds of millions of Reverend Mothers. Lucilla is forced to land on Gammu where she seeks refuge with an underground group of Jews. The Rabbi gives Lucilla sanctuary   but to save his organization he must deliver her to the Matres. Before doing so   he reveals Rebecca   a ""wild"" Reverend Mother who has gained her Other Memory without Bene Gesserit training. Lucilla shares minds with Rebecca   who promises to take the memories of Lampadas safely back to the Sisterhood. Lucilla is then ""betrayed""   and taken before the Great Honored Matre Dama   who tries to persuade her to join the Honored Matres   preserving her life in exchange for Bene Gesserit secrets. Lucilla refuses   and Dama ultimately kills her. Back on Chapterhouse   Odrade confronts Duncan and forces him to admit that he is a Mentat   proving that he retains the memories of his many ghola lives. He does not reveal his mysterious visions of two people. Meanwhile   Murbella collapses under the pressure of Bene Gesserit training   giving in to ""word weapons"" that the Bene Gesserit had planted to undermine her earlier Honored Matre identity. Murbella realizes that she wants to be Bene Gesserit. Odrade believes that the Bene Gesserit made a mistake in fearing emotion   and that in order to evolve   the Bene Gesserit must learn to accept emotions. Odrade permits Duncan to watch Murbella undergo the spice agony   making him the first man ever to do so. Murbella survives the ordeal and becomes a Reverend Mother. Odrade then confronts Sheeana   discovering that Duncan and Sheeana have been allied together for some time. Sheeana does not reveal that they have been considering the option of reawakening Teg's memory through Imprinting   nor does Odrade discover that Sheeana has the keys to Duncan's no-ship prison. Odrade continues molding Scytale   with Sheeana showing him a baby sandworm   the Bene Gesserit's own long term supply of spice   and destroying Scytale's main bargaining card. Finally   Teg is awakened by Sheeana using imprinting techniques. Odrade appoints him again as Bashar of the military forces of the Sisterhood for the assault on the Honored Matres. Odrade next calls a meeting of all the Bene Gesserit   announcing her plan to attack the Honored Matres. She tells them that this attack will be led by Teg. She also announces candidates to succeed her as Mother Superior; she will share her memories with Murbella and Sheeana before she leaves. Odrade then goes to meet the Great Honored Matre. Under cover of Odrade's diplomacy   the Bene Gesserit forces under Teg attack Gammu with tremendous force. Teg uses his secret ability to see no-ships to secure control of the system. Survivors of the attack flee to Junction   and Teg follows them there and carries all with him. Victory for the Bene Gesserit seems inevitable. In the midst of this battle   the Jews (including Rebecca with her precious memories) take refuge with the Bene Gesserit fleet. Logno &mdash; chief advisor to Dama &mdash; assassinates Dama with poison and assumes control of the Honored Matres. Her first act surprises Odrade greatly. Too late Odrade and Teg realize they have fallen into a trap   and the Honored Matres use a mysterious weapon to turn defeat into victory   as well as capturing Odrade. Murbella saves as much of the Bene Gesserit force as she can and they begin to withdraw to Chapterhouse. Odrade   however   had planned for the possible failure of the Bene Gesserit attack and left Murbella instructions for a last desperate gamble. Murbella pilots a small craft down to the surface   announcing herself as an Honored Matre who   in the confusion   has managed to escape the Bene Gesserit with all their secrets. She arrives on the planet and is taken to the Great Honored Matre. Unable to control her anger   Logno attacks but is killed by Murbella. Awed by her physical prowess   the remaining Honored Matres are forced to accept her as their new leader. Odrade is also killed in the melee and Murbella shares memories with her   thereby also becoming Reverend Mother Superior. Murbella's ascension to leadership is not accepted as victory by all the Bene Gesserit. Some flee Chapterhouse   notably Sheeana   who has a vision of her own   and is joined by Duncan. The two escape in the giant no-ship   with Scytale   Teg and the Jews. Murbella recognizes their plan at the last minute   but is powerless to stop them. Watching this escape with interest are Daniel and Marty   the observers Duncan had been having visions of. The story ends on a cliffhanger with several questions left unanswered regarding the merging of the Honored Matres and Bene Gesserit   the fates of those on the escaped no-ship (including the role of Scytale   the development of Idaho and Teg   and the role of the Jews)   the identity of the god-like characters in the book's final chapter and the ultimate mystery of what chased the Honored Matres

24  25  6921  Carmilla  Sheridan Le Fanu  "{""/m/039vk"": ""Gothic fiction""}"  " The story is presented by Le Fanu as part of the casebook of Dr Hesselius   whose departures from medical orthodoxy rank him as the first occult doctor in literature. The story is narrated by Laura   one of the two main protagonists of the tale. Laura begins her tale by relating her childhood in a ""picturesque and solitary"" castle in the midst of an extensive forest in Styria where she lives with her father   a wealthy English widower   retired from the Austrian Service. When she is six years old   Laura has a vision of a beautiful visitor in her bedchamber. She later claims to have been bitten on the chest   although no wounds are found on her. 12 years later   Laura and her father are admiring the sunset in front of the castle when her father tells her of a letter he received earlier from his friend General Spielsdorf. The General was supposed to bring his niece   Bertha Rheinfeldt   to visit the two   but the niece suddenly died under mysterious circumstances. The General ambiguously concludes that he will discuss the circumstances in detail when they meet later. Laura is saddened by the loss of a potential friend   and longs for a companion. A carriage accident outside Laura's home unexpectedly brings a girl of Laura's age into the family's care. Her name is Carmilla. Both girls instantly recognize the other from the 'dream' they both had when they were young. Carmilla appears injured after her carriage accident   but her mysterious mother informs Laura's father that her journey is urgent and cannot be delayed. She arranges to leave her daughter with Laura and her father until she can return in three months. Before she leaves she sternly notes that her daughter will not disclose any information whatsoever about her family   past   or herself and that Carmilla is of sound mind. Laura comments that this information seems needless to say   and her father laughs it off. Carmilla and Laura grow to be very close friends   but occasionally Carmilla's mood abruptly changes. She sometimes makes unsettling romantic advances towards Laura. Carmilla refuses to tell anything about herself or her background   despite questioning from Laura. Her secrecy isn't the only mysterious thing about her. Carmilla sleeps much of the day   and seems to sleepwalk at night. When a funeral procession passes by the two girls and Laura begins singing a hymn   Carmilla bursts out in rage and scolds Laura for singing a Christian song. When a shipment of family heirloom restored portraits arrives at the castle   Laura finds one of her ancestors   ""Mircalla   Countess Karnstein""   dated 1698. The portrait resembles Carmilla exactly   down to the mole on her neck. During Carmilla's stay   Laura has nightmares of a fiendish cat-like beast entering her room at night and biting her on the chest. The beast then takes the form of a female figure and disappears through the door without opening it. Laura's health declines and her father has a doctor examine her. He speaks privately with her father and only asks that Laura never be left unattended. Her father then sets out with Laura in a carriage for the ruined village of Karnstein. They leave a message behind asking Carmilla and one of the governesses entreated to follow after once the perpetually late-sleeping Carmilla wakes up. En route to Karnstein   Laura and her father encounter General Spielsdorf. He tells them his own ghastly story. Spielsdorf and his niece had met a young woman named Millarca and her enigmatic mother at a costume ball. The General's niece was immediately taken with Millarca. The mother convinced the General that she was an old friend of his and asked that Millarca be allowed to stay with them for three weeks while she attended to a secret matter of great importance. The General's niece fell mysteriously ill and suffered exactly the same symptoms as Laura. After consulting with a priestly doctor who he had specially ordered   the General came to the realization that his niece was being visited by a vampire. He hid in a closet with a sword and waited until seeing a fiendish cat-like creature stalk around his niece's bedroom and bite her on the neck. He then leapt from his hiding place and attacked the beast   which took the form of Millarca. She fled through the locked door   unharmed. The General's niece died immediately afterward. When they arrive at Karnstein the General asks a nearby woodsman where he can find the tomb of Mircalla Karnstein. The woodsman relates that the tomb was relocated long ago   by the hero who vanquished the vampires that haunted the region. While the General and Laura are left alone in the ruined chapel   Carmilla appears. The General and Carmilla both fly into a rage upon seeing each other and the General attacks her with an axe. Carmilla flees and the General explains to Laura that Carmilla is also Millarca   both anagrams for the original name of the vampire Countess Mircalla Karnstein. The party is then joined by Baron Vordenburg   the descendant of the hero who rid the area of vampires long ago. Vordenburg is an authority on vampires and has discovered that his ancestor was romantically involved with the Countess Karnstein   before she died and became one of the undead. Using his forefather's notes he locates the hidden tomb of Carmilla. An Imperial Commission is then summoned who exhume and destroy the body of the vampire on behalf of the ruling Habsburg Monarchy   within whose domains Styria is situated. Afterwards   Laura's father takes her on a year-long vacation to recover from the trauma and regain her health."  8  ['Gothic fiction']  the story is presented by le fanu as part of the casebook of dr

25  26  7817  The Cider House Rules  John Irving  "{""/m/02xlf"": ""Fiction""}"  " Homer Wells grows up in an orphanage where he spends his childhood ""being of use"" as a medical assistant to the director   Dr. Wilbur Larch   whose history is told in flashbacks: After a traumatic misadventure with a prostitute as a young man   Wilbur turns his back on sex and love   choosing instead to help women with unwanted pregnancies give birth and then keeping the babies in an orphanage. He makes a point of maintaining an emotional distance from the orphans   so that they can more easily make the transition into an adoptive family   but when it becomes clear that Homer is going to spend his entire childhood at the orphanage   Wilbur trains the orphan as an obstetrician and then comes to love him. Wilbur's and Homer's lives are complicated by Wilbur also secretly being an abortionist. Wilbur came to this work reluctantly   but he is driven by having seen the horrors of back-alley operations. Homer   upon learning Wilbur's secret   considers it morally wrong. As a young man   Homer befriends a young couple   Candy Kendall and Wally Worthington   who come to St. Cloud's for an abortion. Homer leaves the orphanage   and returns with them to Ocean View Orchards (Wally's family's orchard) in Heart's Rock   near the Maine Coast. Wally and Homer become best friends and Homer develops a secret love for Candy. Wally goes off to war and his plane is shot down over Burma. He is presumed missing by the military   but Homer and Candy both believe he is dead and move on with their lives. They have sexual relations   and Candy becomes pregnant. They go back to St. Cloud's Orphanage   where their child is born and named Angel. Subsequently   Wally is found in Burma and returns home   paralyzed from the waist down. He is still able to have sexual intercourse but is sterile due to an infection received in Burma. They lie to the family about Angel's parentage   claiming that Homer decided to adopt him. Wally and Candy marry shortly afterward   but Candy and Homer maintain a secret affair that lasts some 15 years. Many years later   teenaged Angel falls in love with Rose Rose   the daughter of the head migrant worker at the apple orchard. She becomes pregnant by her father   and Homer performs an abortion on her. Homer decides to return to the orphanage after the death of Dr. Larch   to work as the new director. Though he maintains his distaste for abortions   he continues Dr. Larch's legacy of honoring the choice of his patients   and he dreams of the day when abortions are free   legal   and safe   so he'll no longer feel obliged to offer them. A subplot follows the character Melony   who grew up alongside Homer in the orphanage. She was Homer's first girlfriend in a relationship of circumstances. After Homer leaves the orphanage   so does she in an effort to find him. She eventually becomes an electrician and takes a female lover   Lorna. Melony is an extremely stoic woman   who refuses to press charges against a man who brutally broke her nose and arm so that she can later retaliate herself. She is the catalyst that transforms Homer from his comfortable but not entirely admirable position at the apple orchard to becoming Dr. Larch's replacement at the orphanage."  20  ['Fiction']  homer

The main writers of these items are also the novel's protagonists. The story is occasionally supplemented with newspaper clippings that relate events not directly witnessed by the story's characters. The tale begins with Jonathan Harker   a newly qualified English solicitor   journeying by train and carriage from England to Count Dracula's crumbling   remote castle (situated in the Carpathian Mountains on the border of Transylvania   Bukovina and Moldavia). The purpose of his mission is to provide legal support to Dracula for a real estate transaction overseen by Harker's employer   Peter Hawkins   of Exeter in England. At first enticed by Dracula's gracious manner   Harker soon discovers that he has become a prisoner in the castle. He also begins to see disquieting facets of Dracula's nocturnal life. One night while searching for a way out of the castle   and against Dracula's strict admonition not to venture outside his room at night   Harker falls under the spell of three wanton female vampires   ""the Sisters."" He is saved at the last second by the Count   because he wants to keep Harker alive just long enough to obtain needed legal advice and teachings about England and London (Dracula's planned travel destination was to be among the ""teeming millions""). Harker barely escapes from the castle with his life. Not long afterward   a Russian ship   the Demeter   having weighed anchor at Varna   runs aground on the shores of Whitby   England   during a fierce tempest. All of the crew are missing and presumed dead   and only one body is found   that of the captain tied to the ship's helm. The captain's log is recovered and tells of strange events that had taken place during the ship's journey. These events led to the gradual disappearance of the entire crew apparently owing to a malevolent presence on board the ill-fated ship. An animal described as a large dog is seen on the ship leaping ashore. The ship's cargo is described as silver sand and boxes of ""mould""   or earth   from Transylvania. Soon Dracula is tracking Harker's devoted fiancÃ©e   Wilhelmina ""Mina"" Murray   and her friend   Lucy Westenra. Lucy receives three marriage proposals in one day   from Dr. John Seward; Quincey Morris; and the Hon. Arthur Holmwood (later Lord Godalming). Lucy accepts Holmwood's proposal while turning down Seward and Morris   but all remain friends. There is a notable encounter between Dracula and Seward's patient Renfield   an insane man who means to consume insects   spiders   birds   and other creatures &mdash; in ascending order of size &mdash; in order to absorb their ""life force"". Renfield acts as a motion sensor   detecting Dracula's proximity and supplying clues accordingly. Lucy begins to waste away suspiciously. All of her suitors fret   and Seward calls in his old teacher   Professor Abraham Van Helsing from Amsterdam. Van Helsing immediately determines the cause of Lucy's condition but refuses to disclose it   knowing that Seward's faith in him will be shaken if he starts to speak of vampires. Van Helsing tries multiple blood transfusions   but they are clearly losing ground. On a night when Van Helsing must return to Amsterdam (and his message to Seward asking him to watch the Westenra household is delayed)   Lucy and her mother are attacked by a wolf. Mrs. Westenra   who has a heart condition   dies of fright   and Lucy apparently dies soon after. Lucy is buried   but soon afterward the newspapers report children being stalked in the night by a ""bloofer lady"" (as they describe it)   i.e. ""beautiful lady"". Van Helsing   knowing that this means Lucy has become a vampire   confides in Seward   Lord Godalming and Morris. The suitors and Van Helsing track her down   and after a disturbing confrontation between her vampiric self and Arthur   they stake her heart   behead her   and fill her mouth with garlic. Around the same time   Jonathan Harker arrives home from recuperation in Budapest (where Mina joined and married him after his escape from the castle); he and Mina also join the coalition   who turn their attentions to dealing with Dracula. After Dracula learns of Van Helsing's and the others' plot against him   he takes revenge by visiting â and feeding from â Mina at least three times. Dracula also feeds Mina his blood   creating a spiritual bond between them to control her. The only way to forestall this is to kill Dracula first. Mina slowly succumbs to the blood of the vampire that flows through her veins   switching back and forth from a state of consciousness to a state of semi-trance during which she is telepathically connected with Dracula. This telepathic connection is established to be two-way   in that the Count can influence Mina   but in doing so betrays to her awareness of his surroundings. After the group sterilizes all of his lairs in London by putting pieces of consecrated host in each box of earth   Dracula flees back to his castle in Transylvania   transported in a box with transfer and portage instructions forwarded   pursued by Van Helsing's group   who themselves are aided by Van Helsing hypnotizing Mina and questioning her about the Count. The group splits in three directions. Van Helsing goes to the Count's castle and kills his trio of brides   and shortly afterwards all converge on the Count just at sundown under the shadow of the castle. Harker and Quincey rush to Dracula's box   which is being transported by Gypsies. Harker shears Dracula through the throat with a Kukri while the mortally wounded Quincey   slashed by one of the crew   stabs the Count in the heart with a Bowie knife. Dracula crumbles to dust   and Mina is freed from his curse. The book closes with a note about Mina's and Jonathan's married life and the birth of their first-born son   whom they name after all four members of the party   but refer to only as Quincey in remembrance of their American friend."  11  "['Science Fiction'   'Speculative fiction'   'Horror'   'Invasion literature'   'Mystery'   'Epistolary novel'   'Fantasy'   'Fiction'   'Gothic fiction']"

While mostly a rational man of sound reason   his reading of books of chivalry in excess has had a profound effect on him   leading to the distortion of his perception and the wavering of his mental faculties. In essence   he believes every word of these books of chivalry to be true though   for the most part   the content of these books is clearly fiction. Otherwise   his wits   in regards to everything other than chivalry   are intact. He decides to go out as a knight-errant in search of adventure. He dons an old suit of armour   renames himself ""Don Quixote de la Mancha  "" and names his skinny horse ""Rocinante"". He designates a neighboring farm girl as his lady love   renaming her Dulcinea del Toboso   while she knows nothing about this. He sets out in the early morning and ends up at an inn   which he believes to be a castle. He asks the innkeeper   whom he thinks to be the lord of the castle   to dub him a knight. He spends the night holding vigil over his armor   where he becomes involved in a fight with muleteers who try to remove his armor from the horse trough so that they can water their mules. The innkeeper then dubs him a knight to be rid of him   and sends him on his way. Don Quixote next ""frees"" a young boy who is tied to a tree and beaten by his master by making his master swear on the chivalric code to treat the boy fairly. The boy's beating is continued as soon as Quixote leaves. Don Quixote has a run-in with traders from Toledo   who ""insult"" the imaginary Dulcinea   one of whom severely beats Don Quixote and leaves him on the side of the road. Don Quixote is found and returned to his home by a neighboring peasant. The Second Sally While Don Quixote is unconscious in his bed   his niece   the housekeeper   the parish curate   and the local barber secretly burn most of the books of chivalry   and seal up his library pretending that a magician has carried it off. After a short period of feigning health   Don Quixote approaches his neighbor   Sancho Panza   and asks him to be his squire   promising him governorship of an island. The uneducated Sancho agrees   and the pair sneak off in the early dawn. It is here that their series of famous adventures begin   starting with Don Quixote's attack on windmills that he believes to be ferocious giants. The two next encounter a group of friars accompanying a lady in a carriage. They are heavily cloaked   as is the lady   to protect themselves from the hot climate and dust on the road. Don Quixote takes the friars to be enchanters who hold the lady captive. He knocks a friar from his horse   and is immediately challenged by an armed Basque traveling with the company. As he has no shield   the Basque uses a pillow to protect himself   which saves him when Don Quixote strikes him. The combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and demanding those traveling with her to ""surrender"" to Don Quixote. The Pastoral Wanderings Sancho and Don Quixote go on   and fall in with a group of goatherds. Don Quixote tells Sancho and the goatherds about the ""Golden Age"" of man   reminiscent of both Ovid and the later Rousseau in which property does not exist   and men live in peace. The goatherds invite the Knight and Sancho to the funeral of GrisÃ³stomo   once a student who left his studies to become a shepherd after reading Pastoral novels   seeking the shepherdess Marcela. At the funeral Marcela appears   delivering a long speech vindicating herself from the bitter verses written about her by GrisÃ³stomo   claiming her own autonomy and freedom from expectations put on her by Pastoral clichÃ©s. She disappears into the woods   and Don Quixote and Sancho follow. Ultimately giving up   the two stop and dismount by a pond to rest. Some Galicians arrive to water their ponies   and Rocinante (Don Quixote's horse) attempts to mate with the ponies. The Galicians hit Rocinante with clubs to dissuade him   which Don Quixote takes as a threat and runs to defend Rocinante. The Galicians beat Don Quixote and Sancho leaving them in great pain. The Adventures with Cardenio and Dorotea After Don Quixote frees a group of galley slaves   The Knight and Sancho wander into the Sierra Morena   and there encounter the dejected Cardenio. Cardenio relates the first part of his story   in which he falls deeply in love with his childhood friend Luscinda   and is hired as the companion to the Duke's son   leading to his friendship with the Duke's younger son   Don Fernando. Cardenio confides in Don Fernando his love for Luscinda and the delays in their engagement   caused by Cardenio's desire to keep with tradition. After reading Cardenio's poems praising Luscinda   Don Fernando falls in love with her. Don Quixote interrupts when Cardenio suggests that his beloved may have become unfaithful after the formulaic stories of spurned lovers in Chivalric novels. In the course of their travels   the protagonists meet innkeepers   prostitutes   goatherds   soldiers   priests   escaped convicts   and scorned lovers. These encounters are magnified by Don Quixoteâs imagination into chivalrous quests. Don Quixoteâs tendency to intervene violently in matters which do not concern him   and his habit of not paying his debts   result in many privations   injuries   and humiliations (with Sancho often getting the worst of it). Finally   Don Quixote is persuaded to return to his home village. The author hints that there was a third quest   but says that records of it have been lost. The Third Sally Although the two parts are now normally published as a single work   Don Quixote   Part Two was a sequel published ten years after the original novel. While Part One was mostly farcical   the second half is more serious and philosophical about the theme of deception. As Part Two begins   it is assumed that the literate classes of Spain have all read the first part of the history of Don Quixote and his squire. Cervantes's meta-fictional device was to make even the characters in the story familiar with the publication of Part One   as well as with an actually published fraudulent Part Two. When strangers encounter the duo in person   they already know their famous history. A Duke and Duchess   and others   deceive Don Quixote for entertainment   setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes. Some of them are quite sadistic   and they put Don Quixote's sense of chivalry and his devotion to Dulcinea through many tests. Even Sancho deceives him at one point. Pressured into finding Dulcinea   Sancho brings back three dirty and ragged peasant girls   and tells Don Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting. When Don Quixote only sees the peasant girls   Sancho pretends that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment. Sancho later gets his comeuppance for this when   as part of one of the duke and duchess's pranks   the two are led to believe that the only method to release Dulcinea from her spell is for Sancho to give himself a surplus of three thousand lashes. Sancho naturally resists this course of action   leading to friction with his master. Under the duke's patronage   Sancho eventually gets a governorship   though it is false   and proves to be a wise and practical ruler; though this ends in humiliation as well. Near the end   Don Quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity: an inn is just an inn   not a castle. The lengthy untold ""history"" of Don Quixote's adventures in knight-errantry comes to a close after his battle with the Knight of the White Moon   in which we the readers find him conquered. Bound by the rules of chivalry   Don Quixote submits to prearranged terms that the vanquished is to obey the will of the conqueror   which in this case   is that Don Quixote is to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for the period of one year (a duration in which he may be cured of his madness). Defeated and dejected   he and Sancho start their journey home. Part Two of Don Quixote is often regarded as the birth of modern literature   as it explores the concept of a character understanding that he is being written about. This is a theme much explored in writings of the 20th Century. Upon returning to his village   Don Quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside and live the pastoral existence of shepherd   although his housekeeper   who has a more realistic view of the hard life of a shepherd   urges him to stay home and tend to his own affairs. Soon after   he retires to his bed with a deathly illness   possibly brought on by melancholy over his defeats and humiliations. One day   he awakes from a dream having fully recovered his sanity. Sancho tries to restore his faith   but Alonso Quixano   for that is his true name   can only renounce his previous existence and apologize for the harm he has caused. He dictates his will   which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry. After Alonso Quixano dies   the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate   and that any further books about Don Quixote would be spurious."  13  "['Parody'   ""Children's

By accepting the role of messiah to the Fremen   Paul had unleashed a jihad which conquered most of the known universe. While Paul is the most powerful Emperor ever known   he is powerless to stop the lethal excesses of the religious juggernaut he has created. Although sixty-one billion people have perished   Paul's prescient visions indicate that this is far from the worst possible outcome for humanity. Motivated by this knowledge   Paul hopes to set humanity on a course that will not inevitably lead to stagnation and destruction   while at the same time acting as ruler of the Empire and focal point of the Fremen religion. The Bene Gesserit   Spacing Guild and Tleilaxu enter into a conspiracy to dethrone Paul   the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam enlisting Paul's own consort Princess Irulan   daughter of the deposed Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV. Paul has refused to father a child with Irulan (or even touch her)   but his Fremen concubine Chani has also failed to produce an heir   causing tension within his monarchy. Desperate both to secure her place in the Atreides dynasty and to preserve the Atreides bloodline for the Bene Gesserit breeding program   Irulan has secretly been giving contraceptives to Chani. Paul is aware of this fact   but has foreseen that the birth of his heir will bring Chani's death   and does not want to lose her. Because of the way oracles interfere with one another's prescience   the Guild Navigator Edric is able to shield the conspiracy from Paul's visions of the future. The Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale gives Paul a gift he cannot resist: a Tleilaxu-grown ghola of the deceased Duncan Idaho   Paul's childhood teacher and friend   now called ""Hayt"". The conspirators hope the presence of Hayt will undermine Paul's ability to rule by forcing Paul to question himself and the empire he has created. Furthermore   Paul's acceptance of the gift weakens his support among the Fremen   who see the Tleilaxu and their tools as unclean. Chani   taking matters into her own hands   switches to a traditional Fremen fertility diet   preventing Irulan from being able to tamper with her food   and soon becomes pregnant. Otheym   one of Paul's former Fedaykin death commandos   reveals evidence of a Fremen conspiracy against Paul. Otheym gives Paul his dwarf Tleilaxu servant Bijaz who   like a recording machine   can remember faces   names   and details. Paul accepts reluctantly   seeing the strands of a Tleilaxu plot. As Paul's soldiers attack the conspirators   others set off an atomic weapon called a stone burner   purchased from the Tleilaxu   that destroys the area and blinds Paul. By tradition   all blind Fremen are abandoned in the desert   but Paul shocks the Fremen and entrenches his godhead by proving he can still see   even without eyes. His oracular powers have become so developed that he can foresee in his mind everything that happens   as though his eyes still function. By moving through his life in lockstep with his visions   he can see even the slightest details of the world around him. The disadvantage of this is his inability to change any part of his destiny so long as he wishes to appear sighted. The unraveling of the Fremen conspiracy reveals that Korba   a former Fedaykin and now high priest of Paul's church   is among Paul's enemies. Hayt interrogates Bijaz   but the little manâactually an agent of the Tleilaxuâuses a specific humming intonation that renders Hayt open to implanted commands. Bijaz programs Hayt to offer Paul a bargain when Chani dies: Chani's rebirth as a ghola   and the hope that Duncan Idaho's memories might be reawakened   in return for Paul sacrificing the throne and going into exile. Bijaz also implants a compulsion that will force Hayt to attempt to kill Paul   given the appropriate circumstances. Hayt remains oblivious of the programming. Eventually news is brought that Chani has died giving birth. Paul's reaction to it triggers the compulsions in the mind of Hayt   who attempts to kill Paul. But rather than kill his beloved Paul   Duncan's ghola body reacts against its own programming and recovers Duncan's full consciousness. He remains conscious of the Zen-Sunni and Mentat training given to Hayt by the Tleilaxu   but is no longer bound to their programming. Paul and Chani's newborn twins are ""pre-born""   like Paul's sister Alia had been   and come into the world fully conscious with Kwisatz Haderach-like access to ancestral memories thanks to a combination of their genes and an in utero exposure to the quantities of spice in Chani's special pregnancy diet. Scytale offers to revive Chani as a ghola in return for all of Paul's CHOAM holdings. Paul refuses to submit to the possibility that the Tleilaxu might program Chani in some diabolical way   and Scytale threatens the infants with a knife while he negotiates with Alia. Paul has now been rendered completely blind by the presence of his oracular son   yet he is able to kill Scytale with an accurately aimed dagger thanks to a vision from his son's perspective. Now prophetically as well as physically blind   Paul chooses to embrace the Fremen tradition of a blind man walking alone into the desert   winning the fealty of the Fremen for his children   who will inherit his mantle of Emperor. Paul leaves Alia   now romantically involved with Duncan   as regent for the twins   whom he has named Leto and Ghanima. Duncan notes the irony that Paul and Chani's deaths had enabled them to triumph against their enemies   and that Paul has escaped deification by walking into the desert as a man   while guaranteeing Fremen support for the Atreides line."  13  "['Science Fiction'   'Speculative fiction'   ""Children's literature""   'Fiction'   'Novel']"  twelve years after the events described in dune paul

30  31  8757  Darwin's Dangerous Idea  Daniel Dennett  "{""/m/037mh8"": ""Philosophy""   ""/m/06mq7"": ""Science""}"  " ""Starting in the Middle""   Part I of Darwin's Dangerous Idea   gets its name from a quote by Willard Van Orman Quine: ""Analyze theory-building how we will   we all must start in the middle. Our conceptual firsts are middle-sized   middle-distance objects   and our introduction to them and to everything comes midway in the cultural evolution of the race."" The first chapter ""Tell Me Why"" is named after a song. Before Charles Darwin   God was seen as the ultimate cause of all design   or the ultimate answer to 'why?' questions. John Locke argued for the primacy of mind before matter   and David Hume   while exposing problems with Locke's view   could not see any alternative. Darwin provided just such an alternative: evolution. Besides providing evidence of common descent   he introduced a mechanism to explain it: natural selection. According to Dennett   natural selection is a mindless   mechanical and algorithmic process&mdash;Darwin's dangerous idea. The third chapter introduces the concept of ""skyhooks"" and ""cranes"" (see below). He suggests that resistance to Darwinism is based on a desire for skyhooks   which do not really exist. According to Dennett   good reductionists explain apparent design without skyhooks; greedy reductionists try to explain it without cranes. Chapter 4 looks at the tree of life   such as how it can be visualized and some crucial events in life's history. The next chapter concerns the possible and the actual   using the 'Library of Mendel' (the space of all logically possible genomes) as a conceptual aid. In the last chapter of part I   Dennett treats human artifacts and culture as a branch of a unified Design Space. Descent or homology can be detected by shared design features that would be unlikely to appear independently. However   there are also ""Forced Moves"" or ""Good Tricks"" that will be discovered repeatedly   either by natural selection (see convergent evolution) or human investigation. The first chapter of part II   ""Darwinian Thinking in Biology""   asserts that life originated without any skyhooks   and the orderly world we know is the result of a blind and undirected shuffle through chaos. The eighth chapter's message is conveyed by its title   ""Biology is Engineering""; biology is the study of design   function   construction and operation. However   there are some important differences between biology and engineering. Related to the engineering concept of optimization   the next chapter deals with adaptationism   which Dennett endorses   calling Gould and Lewontin's ""refutation"" of it an illusion. Dennett thinks adaptationism is   in fact   the best way of uncovering constraints. The tenth chapter   entitled ""Bully for Brontosaurus""   is an extended critique of Stephen Jay Gould   who Dennett feels has created a distorted view of evolution with his popular writings; his ""self-styled revolutions"" against adaptationism   gradualism and other orthodox Darwinism all being false alarms. The final chapter of part II dismisses directed mutation   the inheritance of acquired traits and Teilhard's ""Omega Point""   and insists that other controversies and hypotheses (like the unit of selection and Panspermia) have no dire consequences for orthodox Darwinism. ""Mind   Meaning   Mathematics and Morality"" is the name of Part III   which begins with a quote from Nietzsche. Chapter 12   ""The Cranes of Culture""   discusses cultural evolution. It asserts that the meme has a role to play in our understanding of culture   and that it allows humans   alone among animals   to ""transcend"" our selfish genes. ""Losing Our Minds to Darwin"" follows   a chapter about the evolution of brains   minds and language. Dennett criticizes Noam Chomsky's perceived resistance to the evolution of language   its modeling by artificial intelligence   and reverse engineering. The evolution of meaning is then discussed   and Dennett uses a series of thought experiments to persuade the reader that meaning is the product of meaningless   algorithmic processes. Chapter 15 asserts that GÃ¶del's Theorem does not make certain sorts of artificial intelligence impossible. Dennett extends his criticism to Roger Penrose. The subject then moves on to the origin and evolution of morality   beginning with Thomas Hobbes (who Dennett calls ""the first sociobiologist"") and Friedrich Nietzsche. He concludes that only an evolutionary analysis of ethics makes sense   though he cautions against some varieties of 'greedy ethical reductionism'. Before moving to the next chapter   he discusses some sociobiology controversies. The penultimate chapter   entitled ""Redesigning Morality""   begins by asking if ethics can be 'naturalized'. Dennett does not believe there is much hope of discovering an algorithm for doing the right thing   but expresses optimism in our ability to design and redesign our approach to moral problems. In ""The Future of an Idea""   the book's last chapter   Dennett praises biodiversity   including cultural diversity. In closing   he uses Beauty and the Beast as an analogy; although Darwin's idea may seem dangerous   it is actually quite beautiful."  7  "['Philosophy'   'Science']"  starting in the middle part i of

31  32  9000  Death of a Hero  Richard Aldington  "{""/m/02xlf"": ""Fiction""}"  " Death of a Hero is the story of a young English artist named George Winterbourne who enlists in the army at the outbreak of World War I. The book is narrated by an unnamed first-person narrator who claims to have known and served with the main character. It is divided into three parts. The first part details George's family history. His father   a middle-class man from England's countryside   marries a poor woman who falsely believes she is marrying into a monied family. After George's birth   his mother takes a series of lovers. George is brought up to be a proper and patriotic member of English society. He is encouraged to follow in his father's insurance business   but fails to do so. After a falling out with his parents   he moves to London to pursue art and live a socialite lifestyle. The second section of the book deals with George's London life. He ingrains himself in socialite society and engages a number of trendy philosophies. After he and his lover   Elizabeth   have a pregnancy scare   they decide to marry. Although they do not have a child   the marriage stands. They decide to leave their marriage open. George takes Elizabeth's close friend as a lover   however   and their marriage begins to fall apart. Just as the situation is becoming particularly heated   England declares war on Germany. George decides to enlist. George trains for the army and is sent to France. (No particular location in France is mentioned. The town behind the front where George spends much of his time is referred to as M---.) He fights on the front for some time. When he returns home   he finds that he has been so affected by the war that he cannot relate to his friends   including his wife and lover. The casualty rate among officers is particularly high at the front. When a number of officers in George's unit are killed   he is promoted. Upon spending time with the other officers   he finds them to be cynical and utilitarian. He loses faith in the war quickly. The story ends with George standing up during a machine-gun barrage. He is killed. At the end of the book there is a poem written from the point of view of a veteran comparing World War I to the Trojan War."  13  ['Fiction']  death of a hero is the story of a young english artist named george winterbourne who enlists in the army at the outbreak of world war i the book is narrated by an unnamed first person narrator who claims to have known and served with the main character it is divided into three parts the first part details georges family history his father a middle class man from englands countryside marries a poor woman who falsely believes she is marrying into a monied family after georges birth his mother takes a series of lovers george is brought up to be a proper and patriotic member of english society he is encouraged to follow in his fathers insurance business but fails to do so after a falling out with his parents he moves to london to pursue art and live a socialite lifestyle the second section of the book deals with georges london life he ingrains himself in socialite society and engages a number of trendy philosophies after he and his lover elizabeth have a pregnancy scare they decide to marry although they do not have a child the marriage stands they decide to leave their marriage open george takes elizabeths close friend as a lover however and their marriage begins to fall apart just as the situation is becoming particularly heated england declares war on germany george decides to enlist george trains for the army and is sent to france no particular location in france is mentioned the town behind the front where george spends much of his time is referred to as m he fights on the front for some time when he returns home he finds that he has been so affected by the war that he cannot relate to his friends including his wife and lover the casualty rate among officers is particularly high at the front when a number of officers in georges unit are killed he is promoted upon spending time with the other officers he finds them to be cynical and utilitarian he loses faith in the war quickly the story ends with george standing up during a machine gun barrage he is killed at the end of the book there is a poem written from the point of view of a veteran comparing world war i to the trojan war  Fiction  death of a hero is the story of a young english artist named george winterbourne who enlists in the army at the outbreak of world war i the book is narrated by an unnamed first person narrator who claims to have known and served with the main character it is divided into three parts the first part details georges family history his father a middle class man from englands countryside marries a poor woman who falsely believes she is marrying into a monied family after georges birth his mother takes a series of lovers george is brought up to be a proper and patriotic member of english society he is encouraged to follow in his fathers insurance business but fails to do so after a falling out with his parents he moves to london to pursue art and live a socialite lifestyle the second section of the book deals with georges london life he ingrains himself in socialite society and engages a number of trendy philosophies after he and his lover elizabeth have a pregnancy scare they decide to marry although they do not have a child the marriage stands they decide to leave their marriage open george takes elizabeths close friend as a lover however and their marriage begins to fall apart just as the situation is becoming particularly heated england declares war on germany george decides to enlist george trains for the army and is sent to france no particular location in france is mentioned the town behind the front where george spends much of his time is referred to as m he fights on the front for some time when he returns home he finds that he has been so affected by the war that he cannot relate to his friends including his wife and lover the casualty rate among officers is particularly high at the front when a number of officers in georges unit are killed he is promoted upon spending time with the other officers he finds them to be cynical and utilitarian he loses faith in the war quickly the story ends with george standing up during a machine gun barrage he is killed at the end of the book there is a poem written from the point of view of a veteran comparing world war i to the trojan war Richard Aldington Fiction
32  33  9662  Exodus    "{""/m/02mdj1"": ""Religious text""}"  " Egypt's Pharaoh   fearful of the Israelites' numbers   orders that all newborn boys be thrown into the Nile. A Levite woman saves her baby by setting him adrift on the river in an ark of bulrushes. Pharaoh's daughter finds the child   names him Moses   and brings him up as her own. But Moses is aware of his origins   and one day   when grown   he kills an Egyptian overseer who is beating a Hebrew slave and has to flee into Midian. There he marries the daughter of Jethro the priest of Midian   and encounters God in a burning bush. Moses asks God for his name: God replies: ""I AM that I AM."" God tells Moses to return to Egypt and lead the Hebrews into Canaan   the land promised to Abraham. Moses returns to Egypt   where God again reveals his name Yahweh to him. Yahweh instructs Moses to appear before the pharaoh and inform him of God's demand that he let God's people go. Moses and his brother Aaron do so   but Pharaoh refuses. Yahweh causes a series of ten plagues to strike Egypt   but whenever Pharaoh begins to relent God causes him to harden his heart. # Blood - The waters of Egypt are turned into blood. All the fish die and water becomes undrinkable. # Frogs - Hordes of frogs swarm the land of Egypt. # Gnats or Lice - Masses of gnats or lice invade Egyptian homes and plague the Egyptian people. # Wild Animals - Wild animals invade Egyptian homes and lands   causing destruction and wrecking havoc. # Pestilence - Egyptian livestock are struck down with disease. # Boils - The Egyptian people are plagued by painful boils that cover their bodies. # Hail - Severe weather destroys Egyptian crops and beats down upon them. # Locusts - Locusts swarm Egypt and eat any remaining crops and food. # Darkness - Darkness covers the land of Egypt for three days. # Death of the Firstborn - The firstborn of every Egyptian family is killed. Even the firstborn of Egyptian animals die. God instructs Moses' to have his people mark their doorposts with the blood of a sacrificed lamb to indicate that they would be ""passed over"" by this plague   hence this has become the Jewish holiday of Passover. The Exodus begins. The Israelites   enumerated at 603  550 able-bodied adult males (not counting Levites) and their families   with their flocks and herds   set out for the mountain of God. Yahweh causes Pharaoh to change his mind about allowing the Israelites to depart; he pursues them   but God destroys the Egyptian army at the crossing of the Red Sea (Yam Suf) and the Israelites celebrate Yahweh's victory. The desert proves arduous   and the Israelites complain and long for Egypt   but God provides manna and miraculous water for them. The Israelites arrive at the mountain of God   where Moses' father-in-law Jethro visits Moses; at his suggestion Moses appoints judges over Israel. The Israelites arrive at the mountain of God   where God asks whether they will agree to be his people. They accept. The people gather at the foot of the mountain   and with thunder and lightning   fire and clouds of smoke   and the sound of trumpets   and the trembling of the mountain   God appears on the peak   and the people see the cloud and hear the voice [or possibly ""sound""] of God. Moses and Aaron are told to ascend the mountain. God pronounces the Ten Commandments (the Ethical Decalogue) in the hearing of all Israel. Moses goes up the mountain into the presence of God   who pronounces the Covenant Code (a detailed code of ritual and civil law)   and promises Canaan to them if they obey. Moses comes down the mountain and writes down God's words and the people agree to keep them. God calls Moses up the mountain together with Aaron and the elders of Israel   and they all feast in the presence of God. God calls Moses up the mountain to receive a set of stone tablets containing the law   and he and Joshua go up   leaving Aaron in charge. God gave Moses instructions for the construction of the tabernacle so that God could dwell permanently among his chosen people   as well as instructions for the priestly vestments   the altar and its appurtenances   the procedure to be used to ordain the priests   and the daily sacrifices to be offered. Aaron was appointed as the first high priest   with the priesthood to be hereditary in his line. God gave Moses the two tables of stone containing the words of the ten commandments spoken to the people in the day of the assembly   written with the ""finger of God"". While Moses is with God   Aaron makes a golden calf   which the people worship. God informs Moses of their apostasy and threatens to kill them all   but relents when Moses pleads for them. Moses comes down from the mountain   smashes the stone tablets in anger   and commands the Levites to massacre the unfaithful Israelites. God commands Moses to make two new tablets on which He will personally write the words that were on the first tablets. Moses ascends the mountain   God dictates the Ten Commandments (the Ritual Decalogue)   and Moses writes them on the tablets. Moses descends from the mountain   and his face is transformed   so that from that time onwards he has to hide his face with a veil. Moses assembles the Hebrews and repeats to them the commandments he has received from God   which are to keep the Sabbath and to construct the Tabernacle. ""And all the construction of the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting was finished   and the children of Israel did according to everything that God had commanded Moses""   and from that time God dwelt in the Tabernacle and ordered the travels of the Hebrews."  10  ['Religious text']  egypts pharaoh fearful of the israelites numbers orders that all newborn boys be thrown into the nile a levite woman

33  34  10861  The Trial  Franz Kafka  "{""/m/02xlf"": ""Fiction""   ""/m/0pym5"": ""Absurdist fiction""   ""/m/05hgj"": ""Novel""}"  " On his thirtieth birthday   the chief financial officer of a bank   Josef K.   is unexpectedly arrested by two unidentified agents from an unspecified agency for an unspecified crime. The agents' boss later arrives and holds a mini tribunal in the room of K.'s neighbor   FrÃ¤ulein BÃ¼rstner. K. is not taken away   however   but left ""free"" to await instructions from the Committee of Affairs. He goes to work   and that night apologizes to FrÃ¤ulein BÃ¼rstner for the intrusion into her room. At the end of the conversation he suddenly kisses her. K. receives a phone calling summoning him to court   and the coming Sunday is arranged as the date. No time is set and the address is given to him. The address turns out to be a huge tenement building. K. has to explore to find the court   which turns out to be in the attic. The room is airless   shabby   and crowded   and although he has no idea what he is charged with   or what authorizes the process   makes a long speech denigrating the whole process   including the agents who arrested him   and during which an attendant's wife is raped. He then returns home. K. later goes to visit the court again   although he has not been summoned. Court is not in session. He instead talks with the attendant's wife   who attempts to seduce him into taking her away   and who gives him more information about the process and offers to help him. K. later goes with the attendant to a higher level of the attic where it turns out that the offices of the court are housed   which are shabby and airless. K. returns home to find FrÃ¤ulein Montag   a lodger from another room   moving in with FrÃ¤ulein BÃ¼rstner. He suspects that this is to prevent him from pursuing his affair with the latter woman. Yet another lodger   Captain Lanz   appears to be in league with Montag. Later   in a store room at his own bank   K. discovers the two agents   who arrested him   being whipped by a flogger for asking K. for bribes   as a result of complaints K. made at court. K. tries to argue with the flogger   saying that the men need not be whipped   but the flogger cannot be swayed. The next day he returns to the store room and is shocked to find everything as he had found it the day before   including the Whipper and the two agents. K. is visited by his uncle   who was K.'s guardian. The uncle seems distressed by K.'s predicament. At first sympathetic   he becomes concerned K. is underestimating the seriousness of the case. The uncle introduces K. to a lawyer   who is attended by Leni   a nurse   who K.'s uncle suspects is the advocate's mistress. During the discussion it becomes clear how different this process is from regular legal proceedings â guilt is assumed   the bureaucracy running it is vast with many levels   and everything is secret   from the charge   to the rules of the court   to the authority behind the courts â even the identity of the judges at the higher levels. The attorney tells him that he can prepare a brief for K.   but since the charge is unknown and the rules are unknown   it is difficult work. It also never may be read. Yet it is very important. The lawyer says that his most important task is to deal with powerful court officials behinds the scenes. As they talk   the lawyer reveals that the Chief Clerk of the Court has been sitting hidden in the darkness of a corner. The Chief Clerk emerges to join the conversation   but K. is called away by Leni   who takes him to the next room   where she offers to help him and seduces him. They have a sexual encounter. Afterwards K. meets his uncle outside   who is angry and   who claims that K.'s lack of respect has also hurt K.'s case. K. visits the lawyer several times. The lawyer tells him incessantly how dire his situation is and tells many stories of other hopeless clients and of his behind-the-scenes efforts on behalf of these clients   and brags about his many connections. The brief is never complete. K.'s work at the bank deteriorates as he is consumed with worry about his case. K. is surprised by one of his bank clients   who tells K. that he is aware that K. is dealing with a trial. The client learned of K.'s case from Titorelli   a painter   who told the client about K.'s case and has dealings with the court. The client advises K. to go to Titorelli for advice. Titorelli lives in the attic of a tenement in a suburb on the opposite side of town from the court that K. visited. Three teenage girls taunt K. on the steps and tease him sexually. Titorelli turns out to be an official painter of portraits for the court â an inherited position   and has a deep understanding of the process. K. learns that   to Titorelli's knowledge   not a single defendant has ever been acquitted. He sets out K.'s options and offers to help K. with either. The options are: obtain a provisional verdict of innocence from the lower court   which can be overturned at any time by higher levels of the court leading to re-initiation of the process; or curry favor with the lower judges to keep the process moving albeit at a glacial pace. Titorelli has K. leave through a small back door as the girls are blocking the door through with K. entered. To K.'s shock   the door opens into another warren of the court's offices â again shabby and airless. K. decides to take control of matters himself and visits his lawyer with the intention of dismissing him. At the lawyer's office he meets a downtrodden individual   Block   a client who offers K. some insight from a client's perspective. Block's case has continued for five years and he has gone from being a successful businessman to being almost bankrupt and is virtually enslaved by his dependence on the lawyer and Leni   with whom he appears to be sexually involved. The lawyer mocks Block in front of K. for his dog-like subservience. This experience further poisons K.'s opinion of his lawyer. (This chapter was left unfinished by the author.) K. is asked by the bank to show an Italian client around local places of cultural interest   but the Italian client   short of time   asks K. to take him only to the cathedral   setting a time to meet there. When the client doesn't show up   K. explores the cathedral which is empty except for an old woman and a church official. K. notices a priest who seems to be preparing to give a sermon from a small second pulpit   and K. begins to leave   lest it begin and K. be compelled to stay for its entirety. Instead of giving a sermon   the priest calls out K.'s name. K. approaches the pulpit and the priest berates him for his attitude toward the trial and for seeking help   especially from women. K. asks him to come down and the two men walk inside the cathedral. The priest works for the court as a chaplain   and tells K. a fable   (which has been published separately as Before the Law) that is meant to explain his situation. K. and the priest discuss the parable. The priest tells K. that the parable is an ancient text of the court   and many generations of court officials have given interpretations. On the eve of K.'s thirty-first birthday   two men arrive at his apartment. He has been waiting for them   and he offers little resistance â indeed the two men take direction from K. as they walk through town. K. leads them to a quarry where the two men place K's head on a discarded block. One of the men produces a double-edged butcher knife   and as the two men pass it back and forth between them   the narrator tells us that ""K. knew then precisely   that it would have been his duty to take the knife...and thrust it into himself."" He does not take the knife. One of the men holds his shoulder and pulls him up and the other man stabs him in the heart and twists the knife twice. K.'s last words are: ""Like a dog!"""  17  "['Fiction'   'Absurdist fiction'   'Novel']"  on his thirtieth birthday the chief financial officer of a bank josef k is unexpectedly arrested by two

He believes it is a dream   and reflects on how dreary life as a traveling salesmen is. He looks at the wall clock and realizes that he has overslept and missed his train for work. He ponders on the consequences of this delay   and is annoyed at how his boss never accepts excuses or explanations from any of his employees no matter how hard working they are   displaying an apparent lack of trusting abilities. Gregor's mother knocks on the door and he answers her. She is concerned for Gregor because he is late for work   which is unorthodox for Gregor. Gregor answers his mother and realizes that his voice has changed   but his answer is short so his mother does not notice the voice change. His sister   Grete   to whom he was very close then whispers through the door and begs him to open the door. All his family members think that he is ill and ask him to open the door. He tries to get out of bed but he is incapable of moving his body. While trying to move   he finds that his office manager   the chief clerk has showed up to check on him. He finally rocks his body to the floor and calls out that he will open the door shortly. Feeling offended by Gregor's delayed response in opening the door   the clerk warns him of the consequences of missing work. He adds that his recent performance has been unsatisfactory. Gregor disagrees and tells him that he will open the door shortly. Nobody on the other side of the door could understand a single word he uttered (Gregor was unaware of the fact that his voice has also transformed) and conclude that he is seriously ill. Finally   Gregor manages to unlock and open the door with his mouth. He apologizes to the office manager for the delay. Horrified by the sight of Gregor's appearance   the manager bolts out of the apartment   while Gregor's mother faints. Gregor tries to catch up with him but his father drives him back into the bedroom with a cane and a rolled newspaper. Gregor injures himself squeezing back through the doorway   and his father slams the door shut. Gregor   exhausted   falls asleep. Gregor wakes and sees that someone has put milk and bread in his room. Initially excited   he quickly discovers that he has no taste for milk   once one of his favorite foods. He settles himself under a couch. The next morning   his sister comes in   sees that he has not touched the milk   and replaces it with rotting food scraps   which Gregor happily eats. This begins a routine in which his sister feeds him and cleans up while he hides under the couch   afraid that his appearance will frighten her. Gregor spends his time listening through the wall to his family members talking. They often discuss the difficult financial situation they find themselves in now that Gregor canât provide for them. Gregor had plans of sending Grete to the conservatorium to pursue violin lessons   something that everyone else including Grete considered to be a dream. Gregor was however pretty determined to do so on the same Christmas before which the metamorphosis occurs. His incapability of being the provider of his family as well as his shattered dreams in respect to his sister coupled with his speechlessness reduces his thought process to a great respect. Gregor also learns that his mother wants to visit him   but his sister and father will not let her. Gregor grows more comfortable with his changed body. He begins climbing the walls and ceiling for amusement. Discovering Gregorâs new pastime   Grete decides to remove some of the furniture to give Gregor more space. She and her mother begin taking furniture away   but Gregor finds their actions deeply distressing. He tries to save a picture on the wall of a woman wearing a fur hat   fur scarf   and a fur muff. Gregorâs mother sees him hanging on the wall and passes out. Grete calls out to Gregorâthe first time anyone has spoken directly to him since his transformation. Gregor runs out of the room and into the kitchen. The father throws apples at Gregor   and one of them sinks into a sensitive spot in his back and remains lodged there   paralyzing his movements for a month and damaging it permanently. Gregor manages to get back into his bedroom but is severely injured. One evening   the cleaning lady leaves Gregorâs door open while the boarders lounge about the living room. Grete has been asked to play the violin for them   and Gregor who usually took care to avoid crossing paths with anyone in the flat   in the midst of his depression and thus caused detachment   creeps out of his bedroom to listen. The boarders   who initially seemed interested in Grete   grow bored with her performance   but Gregor is transfixed by it. One of the boarders spots Gregor and they become alarmed. Gregorâs father tries to shove the boarders back into their rooms   but the three men protest and announce that they will move out immediately without paying rent because of the disgusting conditions in the apartment. Grete   who has by now become tired of taking care of Gregor and is realizing the amount of burden his existence puts on each one in the family   tells her parents that they must get rid of Gregor or they will all be ruined. Her father agrees   wishing Gregor could understand them and would leave of his own accord. Gregor does in fact understand and slowly moves back to the bedroom. There   determined to rid his family of his presence   Gregor dies. Upon discovering that Gregor is dead   the family feels a great sense of relief. The father kicks out the boarders and decides to fire the cleaning lady   who has disposed of Gregorâs body.

Clarisse initially bothers Montag with her incessant questions (and Clarisse is a bit bothered by Montag's uncalled-for reactions   such as laughing when she hasn't said anything funny)   but Montag chooses to tolerate her as she tells him of how she loves nature and walking around and observing how crazy the world has become. The two walk until they reach Clarisse's house (which is next to Montag's). Before Clarisse goes inside   she asks Montag if he's happy. The question catches Montag by surprise and he mulls over his encounter with Clarisse (and how similar it was to another encounter in the park involving an English professor who was afraid of Montag). Montag enters his bedroom   and finds Mildred in bed with her Seashell ear radio in her ear   staring vacantly at the ceiling (just as she's been doing for the past ten years or so). Montag doesn't notice anything wrong until his foot hits Mildred's empty sleeping pill bottle. Montag tries to wake up his wife   but she doesn't respond. Montag calls for medical attention   trying to shout over the screams of the passing jet engines above the house. Because ""accidental"" prescription pill overdoses have become commonplace   the medical department sends over two cynical   uncaring technicians who use a ""Black Cobra"" stomach pump to flush the poisons out of Mildred's system and replace her blood with a fresh   mechanical replacement. Montag stands outside Clarisse's house and sees that she and her family are the only ones in the neighborhood with the lights on and engaging in a spirited conversation. Montag returns to his house   sees that Mildred is looking slightly better than before   and goes to bed. The next day   Montag finds Mildred in the kitchen   making breakfast and complaining of an upset stomach. Montag tries to tell his wife that she overdosed   but is interrupted by Mildred's ramblings of her stomach hurting   but being hungry   and rationalizes that the feeling is from drinking too much alcohol during a party. As Montag leaves for work   he finally tells Mildred (who is watching an interactive soap opera on the ""parlor walls"" -- three enormous   floor-to-ceiling television screens) that she overdosed on sleeping pills. Mildred denies that she would do something that suicidal   but Montag insists. Mildred brushes off the issue and returns to her soap opera. Over the next few days   Montag bonds with Clarisse   who tells him that her interest in intellectual activities has made her an outcast in a society dominated by shallow entertainment   and for that   she has no friends and has to see a psychiatrist. On the final day   however   Clarisse doesn't appear alongside Montag. Montag waits for her   but the wait is short-lived when the train comes to take him to work. A few days later   the firemen are called in to burn down the house of an old woman who has been hoarding books. The firemen go to arrest her   but instead the woman recites a quote from Nicholas Ridley and refuses to leave. As the firemen toss the books from the woman's upstairs bedroom down to the living room floor and spray the pile with kerosene   Montag accidentally reads a line in one of her books and hides it away before any of his coworkers can see. The woman is given a final warning to leave the house   but the woman produces a match. Before she can strike it   the firemen flee   save for Montag   who watches as the woman lights the match   drops it in the kerosene   and is engulfed in flames. Montag comes home from the jarring experience and tries to take his mind off the event by asking a half-asleep Mildred where the two first met and when. Mildred tries to remember   but can't   laughing it off as she heads to the bathroom to take her sleeping pills. As Montag reflects on his stagnant   stilted marriage to Mildred (and how Mildred has become emotionally and mentally dead from watching her ""parlor wall"" entertainment   driving recklessly   and her sleeping pill addiction)   Montag begins to cry after realizing that if Mildred died   he wouldn't miss her at all. Montag then asks Mildred about Clarisse and her whereabouts. Mildred initially denies knowledge of what happened to Clarisse   then tells Montag exactly what happened to her: Clarisse was run over by a speeding car and   once her family heard the news about her death   they packed up and moved away   all of which happened four days ago. Montag is shocked that Mildred didn't tell him the grim news sooner and more disturbed over Mildred's apathy over the death of someone Montag had genuinely liked. Montag wakes up physically ill and begs Mildred to call in sick for him. Mildred refuses and doesn't believe that Montag is really sick (even when Montag vomits on the rug from the stench of kerosene -- which earlier was like a perfume to him -- Mildred is only concerned about whether or not the vomit stain will come out in the wash). Captain Beatty   Montag's fire chief   personally visits him and tells him the story of how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: Over the course of several decades (with the starting point being after the American Civil War)   populations grew and people embraced new media   sports   and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged and degraded to accommodate a shorter attention span. Later   minorities and other special-interest groups began criticizing books for their controversial content while other critics bashed authors for making people feel inferior by publishing works that no one could comprehend. Books became blander and blander due to censorship measures   and eventually   books stopped selling and authors were either locked away in insane asylums or gave up their profession and lived in exile. The only reading material that the society now accepts are captionless comics   three-dimensional sex magazines   trade magazines   and scripts used during the interactive plays on the parlor walls. To get rid of the books from the past (and their copies)   the government implemented a program using the firemen to burn the books (now that houses were being rebuilt to be fire-resistant) and placate the masses. As Beatty is giving his monologue   Mildred tries to fluff Montag's pillow and nearly discovers the book hidden underneath. Montag yells at her and Mildred   at the request of Beatty   quietly leaves the room to watch the parlor walls. Beatty knows that Montag has a book but acts casual about it   stating that it's natural that every fireman gets curious about books and starts to possess one. If the book isn't burned or returned to the firehouse within 24 hours then the firemen will burn it for him. After Beatty has left   Montag shows Mildred the books he has hidden in the ventilator of their home. Mildred tries to incinerate the books   but Montag subdues her and tells her that the two of them are going to read the books to see if they have value. If they do not   he promises the books will be burned and all will return to normal. While going over the stolen books (and nearly getting caught by the firehouse's Mechanical Hound)   Mildred argues with Montag that books have no meaning and questions why Montag dragged her into this. Montag snaps back by mentioning Mildred's overdose   Clarisse's death   the book woman who burned herself   and how society is falling apart due to apathy   ignorance   and a pending war   then states that maybe the books of the past have messages in them that can save society from its own destruction. Before Montag can finish   Mildred gets a call from her friends about coming over to watch The White Clown on the parlor walls. Montag laments that his wife is a lost cause (and he will be too if he can't force himself to absorb the information in the books). Montag then remembers a man he once met in the park a year ago: Faber   a former English professor. Montag seeks Faber's help   though Faber refuses at first due to his cowardice. After Montag starts to rip a few pages from the beginning of a rare copy of The New Testament (one of the few left that actually contains God's word   rather than the bastardized versions that have Jesus and other Biblical characters shilling products)   Faber relents and teaches Montag about the importance of literature in its attempt to explain human existence. He gives Montag an ear-piece communicator he made himself so that Faber can offer guidance throughout his daily activities. At Montag's house   Mildred has friends Mrs. Phelps and Mrs. Bowles over to watch the parlor walls. In the middle of a bloody demolition derby   Montag unplugs the walls and engages the women into meaningful conversation   only to find them concerned only with pleasure in the present moment and indifferent to the upcoming war   death   their families   and politics. Montag then brings out a book of poetry to scare some emotion into them (despite Faber's warnings). Mildred tries to cover up Montag's actions by claiming that   once a year   firemen bring home one book and read it aloud as a form of mocking past literature. Mildred then turns to a page in the book that has the poem Dover Beach on it and assures that none of her friends will understand any of the words. A shaken   confused Montag reads the poem   which ends up making Mrs. Phelps cry. Mrs. Bowles   however   is disgusted   accuses Montag of being nasty   and breaks off her friendship with Mildred. Montag yells at the women to go home and reflect on their empty lives and burns the poetry book while Mildred locks herself in the bathroom to take her pills. Montag returns to the firehouse the next day with only one of the books   which Beatty tosses into the trash. Beatty tells Montag that he had a dream in which they fought endlessly by quoting books to each other. In describing the dream Beatty shows that   despite his disillusionment   he was once an enthusiastic reader. A fire alarm goes off and Beatty picks up the address from the dispatcher system. He reminds Montag of his duty   theatrically leads the crew to the fire engine   and drives it to Montag's house. Beatty orders Montag to destroy his own house   telling him that his wife and neighbors were the ones who reported him. Montag tries to talk to Mildred as she quickly leaves the house   but Mildred ignores him   gets inside a waiting taxi   and vanishes down the street. Montag obeys the chief   destroying the home piece by piece with a flamethrower. After he has incinerated the house   Beatty discovers Montag's earpiece and plans to hunt down Faber. Montag threatens Beatty with the flamethrower and (after Beatty taunts him) burns his boss alive. As Montag flees the scene   the firehouse's mechanical hound attacks him   managing to inject his leg with a tranquilizer. He destroys it with the flamethrower and limps away. Montag flees through the city streets   to Faber's house. Faber urges him to make his way to the countryside and contact the exiled book-lovers who live there. On Faber's television   they watch news reports of another mechanical hound being released   with news helicopters following it to create a public spectacle. Montag leaves Faber's house and escapes the manhunt by jumping into a river and floating downstream into the countryside. There he meets the exiles   who have memorized various books for an upcoming time when society is ready to rediscover them. The war begins   and then   just as suddenly   ends. Montag watches helplessly as jet bombers fly overhead and attack the city with nuclear weapons. During breakfast at dawn   Granger (leader of the group of wandering intellectuals) discusses the legendary phoenix and its endless cycle of long life   death in flames   and rebirth   adding that the phoenix must have some relation to mankind   which constantly repeats its mistakes   but that man has something the phoenix doesn't. It can remember the mistakes it made from before it destroyed itself   and try not make them again. Granger then muses that a large factory of mirrors should be built   so that mankind can take a long look at itself. After the meal is over   the band sets off back toward the city   to rebuild society."  5  "['Science Fiction'   ""Children's literature""   'Speculative fiction'   'Utopian and dystopian fiction'

clarisse initially bothers montag with her incessant questions and clarisse is a bit bothered by montags uncalled for reactions such as laughing when she hasnt said anything funny but montag chooses to tolerate her as she tells him of how she loves nature and walking around and observing how crazy the world has become the two walk until they reach clarisses house which is next to montags before clarisse goes inside she asks montag if hes happy the question catches montag by surprise and he mulls over his encounter with clarisse and how similar it was to another encounter in the park involving an english professor who was afraid of montag montag enters his bedroom and finds mildred in bed with her seashell ear radio in her ear staring vacantly at the ceiling just as shes been doing for the past ten years or so montag doesnt notice anything wrong until his foot hits mildreds empty sleeping pill bottle montag tries to wake up his wife but she doesnt respond montag calls for medical attention trying to shout over the screams of the passing jet engines above the house because accidental prescription pill overdoses have become commonplace the medical department sends over two cynical uncaring technicians who use a black cobra stomach pump to flush the poisons out of mildreds system and replace her blood with a fresh mechanical replacement montag stands outside clarisses house and sees that she and her family are the only ones in the neighborhood with the lights on and engaging in a spirited conversation montag returns to his house sees that mildred is looking slightly better than before and goes to bed the next day montag finds mildred in the kitchen making breakfast and complaining of an upset stomach montag tries to tell his wife that she overdosed but is interrupted by mildreds ramblings of her stomach hurting but being hungry and rationalizes that the feeling is from drinking too much alcohol during a party as montag leaves for work he finally tells mildred who is watching an interactive soap opera on the parlor walls three enormous floor to ceiling television screens that she overdosed on sleeping pills mildred denies that she would do something that suicidal but montag insists mildred brushes off the issue and returns to her soap opera over the next few days montag bonds with clarisse who tells him that her interest in intellectual activities has made her an outcast in a society dominated by shallow entertainment and for that she has no friends and has to see a psychiatrist on the final day however clarisse doesnt appear alongside montag montag waits for her but the wait is short lived when the train comes to take him to work a few days later the firemen are called in to burn down the house of an old woman who has been hoarding books the firemen go to arrest her but instead the woman recites a quote from nicholas ridley and refuses to leave as the firemen toss the books from the womans upstairs bedroom down to the living room floor and spray the pile with kerosene montag accidentally reads a line in one of her books and hides it away before any of his coworkers can see the woman is given a final warning to leave the house but the woman produces a match before she can strike it the firemen flee save for montag who watches as the woman lights the match drops it in the kerosene and is engulfed in flames montag comes home from the jarring experience and tries to take his mind off the event by asking a half asleep mildred where the two first met and when mildred tries to remember but cant laughing it off as she heads to the bathroom to take her sleeping pills as montag reflects on his stagnant stilted marriage to mildred and how mildred has become emotionally and mentally dead from watching her parlor wall entertainment driving recklessly and her sleeping pill addiction montag begins to cry after realizing that if mildred died he wouldnt miss her at all montag then asks mildred about clarisse and her whereabouts mildred initially denies knowledge of what happened to clarisse then tells montag exactly what happened to her clarisse was run over by a speeding car and once her family heard the news about her death they packed up and moved away all of which happened four days ago montag is shocked that mildred didnt tell him the grim news sooner and more disturbed over mildreds apathy over the death of someone montag had genuinely liked montag wakes up physically ill and begs mildred to call in sick for him mildred refuses and doesnt believe that montag is really sick even when montag vomits on the rug from the stench of kerosene which earlier was like a perfume to him mildred is only concerned about whether or not the vomit stain will come out in the wash captain beatty montags fire chief personally visits him and tells him the story of how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in over the course of several decades with the starting point being after the american civil war populations grew and people embraced new media sports and a quickening pace of life books were ruthlessly abridged and degraded to accommodate a shorter attention span later minorities and other special interest groups began criticizing books for their controversial content while other critics bashed authors for making people feel inferior by publishing works that no one could comprehend books became blander and blander due to censorship measures and eventually books stopped selling and authors were either locked away in insane asylums or gave up their profession and lived in exile the only reading material that the society now accepts are captionless comics three dimensional sex magazines trade magazines and scripts used during the interactive plays on the parlor walls to get rid of the books from the past and their copies the government implemented a program using the firemen to burn the books now that houses were being rebuilt to be fire resistant and placate the masses as beatty is giving his monologue mildred tries to fluff montags pillow and nearly discovers the book hidden underneath montag yells at her and mildred at the request of beatty quietly leaves the room to watch the parlor walls beatty knows that montag has a book but acts casual about it stating that its natural that every fireman gets curious about books and starts to possess one if the book isnt burned or returned to the firehouse within hours then the firemen will burn it for him after beatty has left montag shows mildred the books he has hidden in the ventilator of their home mildred tries to incinerate the books but montag subdues her and tells her that the two of them are going to read the books to see if they have value if they do not he promises the books will be burned and all will return to normal while going over the stolen books and nearly getting caught by the firehouses mechanical hound mildred argues with montag that books have no meaning and questions why montag dragged her into this montag snaps back by mentioning mildreds overdose clarisses death the book woman who burned herself and how society is falling apart due to apathy ignorance and a pending war then states that maybe the books of the past have messages in them that can save society from its own destruction before montag can finish mildred gets a call from her friends about coming over to watch the white clown on the parlor walls montag laments that his wife is a lost cause and he will be too if he cant force himself to absorb the information in the books montag then remembers a man he once met in the park a year ago faber a former english professor montag seeks fabers help though faber refuses at first due to his cowardice after montag starts to rip a few pages from the beginning of a rare copy of the new testament one of the few left that actually contains gods word rather than the bastardized versions that have jesus and other

demolition derby montag unplugs the walls and engages the women into meaningful conversation only to find them concerned only with pleasure in the present moment and indifferent to the upcoming war death their families and politics montag then brings out a book of poetry to scare some emotion into them despite fabers warnings mildred tries to cover up montags actions by claiming that once a year firemen bring home one book and read it aloud as a form of mocking past literature mildred then turns to a page in the book that has the poem dover beach on it and assures that none of her friends

He is fat and red-bearded and enjoys a slow   comfortable life. But a rather deaf and short-sighted giant blunders on to his land   and Giles manages to ward him away with a blunderbuss shot in his general direction. The people of the village cheer: Farmer Giles has become a hero. His reputation spreads across the kingdom   and he is rewarded by the King with a sword named Caudimordax (""Tailbiter"")âwhich turns out to be a powerful weapon against dragons. The giant   on returning home   relates to his friends that there are no more knights in the Middle Kingdom   just stinging fliesâactually the scrap metal shot from the blunderbussâand this entices a dragon   Chrysophylax Dives   to investigate the area. The terrified neighbours all expect the accidental hero Farmer Giles to deal with him. The story parodies the great dragon-slaying traditions. The knights sent by the King to pursue the dragon are useless fops   more intent on ""precedence and etiquette"" than on the huge dragon footprints littering the landscape. The only part of a 'dragon' they know is the annual celebratory dragon-tail cake. Giles by contrast clearly recognizes the danger   and resents being sent along to face it.

Expecting hostility because of her notoriety   she is surprised to be welcomed warmly by the dons   and rediscovers her old love of the academic life. Some time later the Warden of Shrewsbury writes to ask for help. There has been an outbreak of anonymous letters   vandalism and threats   apparently from someone within the college   and a scandal is feared. Harriet   herself a victim of poison-pen letters ever since her trial   reluctantly agrees to help   and spends much of the next few months resident at the college   ostensibly to do research on Sheridan Le Fanu and assist a don with her book. As she wrestles with the case   trying to narrow down the list of suspects and avert a major scandal   Harriet is forced to examine her ambivalent feelings about love and marriage   along with her attraction to academia as an intellectual (and emotional) refuge. Her personal dilemma becomes entangled with darkly hinted suspicions and prejudices raised by the crimes at the college   which appear to have been committed by a sexually frustrated female don. Harriet is forced to re-examine her relationship with Wimsey in the light of what she has discovered about herself. Wimsey eventually arrives in Oxford to help her   and she gains a new perspective on him from those who know him   including his nephew   a current undergraduate at the university. The attacks build to a crisis   and the college community of students   dons and servants is almost torn apart by suspicion and fear. There is an attempt to drive a vulnerable student to suicide   and a physical assault on Harriet that almost kills her. The perpetrator is finally unmasked by Wimsey as one of the college servants   revealed to be the widow of a disgraced academic at a northern university. Her husband's academic fraud had been exposed by one of his fellow dons there   destroying his career and driving him to suicide. The don has since moved to Shrewsbury College   and the campaign has been the widow's revenge against intellectual women who move outside their ""proper"" domestic sphere. At the end of the book   Harriet Vane finally accepts Wimsey's proposal of marriage.

39  40  12653  God Emperor of Dune  Frank Herbert  "{""/m/06n90"": ""Science Fiction""   ""/m/014dfn"": ""Speculative fiction""   ""/m/0dwly"": ""Children's literature""   ""/m/02xlf"": ""Fiction""}"  " The seemingly immortal God Emperor Leto II has ruled his Empire for more than 3  500 years   his lifespan lengthened due to his decision in Children of Dune to merge his human body with sandtrout   the haploid phase of the giant sandworms of Arrakis. His continued evolution has slowly transformed him   altering his human form into what he calls a ""pre-worm."" His body has come to resemble a small version of the ancient sandworms of Arrakis &mdash; ribbed   elongated   and covered in scaly sandtrout; his face remains   as do his hands and arms   but his legs and feet have atrophied to be of no use whatsoever and he moves from place to place on a large cart of Ixian manufacture. It is later revealed that his brain has gradually diffused into the rest of his body   becoming a series of nodes throughout his whole form. This distribution of internal organs and his sandtrout skin makes him virtually impervious to harm   even allowing him to survive lasgun fire   but like a sandworm his biology is very vulnerable to water. During his long reign   Leto has enforced a state of peace throughout his empire   both through tight control of his enormous (but limited) hoard of the spice melange and the military might of his Fish Speaker army. The old Imperium is basically non-existent; the Landsraad has ceased to exist   and only a few remnants of the Great Houses survive. The Bene Gesserit and Spacing Guild have endured   although both have been forced to adapt to Leto's absolute control over melange and his powerful prescience   and CHOAM has been reduced to a shadow of its former self. His reign is considered by many to be depraved and despotic   but he is confident that his actions will ensure the survival of the human race. Leto's enforced peace brings stagnation to the galaxy; he himself battles an incessant struggle with boredom and loneliness that overwhelms him because of his everlasting life   close-to-absolute prescience   a loss of vulnerability which renders him incapable of physical intimacy   and his perception of the passage of time in great lengths (as decades may pass without him realizing it). Few people realize the burden that he carries as he deems subjects useful as long as they serve a purpose to the ""Golden Path"" (the end justifying the means). Leto maintains a small and reclusive system of government   and as God   he chooses not to share the inner workings and purpose of his decisions or any sympathy for his cause   as he knows that humanity would not be able to grasp the concept. As his father before him   Leto is utterly incapable of foreseeing his own demise   and concludes that whatever he cannot see and perceive &mdash; and thus control &mdash; is connected to his eventual death; ironically   this amuses him since it is one of the few things that still brings surprise to his otherwise dull existence. Leto has employed a series of gholas grown from the cells of Duncan Idaho   the faithful Swordmaster of House Atreides. Duncan functions both as the captain of Leto's guard   and as a familiar face to calm Leto in his moments of distress. They remind Leto of his family   and he feels that he owes Duncan for his service and devotion to House Atreides. The vast majority of these gholas are made under Leto's instructions of preserving the original Idaho without enhancements; Idaho's masterful abilities   thus   are dwarfed by thousands of years of genetic manipulation displayed by Leto's servants. Over the centuries   a significant number of the gholas have attempted to assassinate Leto through various means after struggling with the conflict between their intense loyalty to House Atreides   and the moral disgust triggered by the repression and stagnation Leto has forced upon the Empire. These feelings   compounded with the uneasy doubt caused by being millennia out of their own time   drives some of the Duncan Idaho gholas insane. Even when he doesn't ask for a new ghola   or considering the circumstances surrounding the previous Idaho's demise   the Tleilaxu usually send one anyway as a token for their survival. Leto's ""Golden Path  "" as he calls it   is a millennia-spanning attempt to produce a human who is invisible to a watcher gifted with prescience. This breeding plan   begun with the marriage of Leto's twin sister Ghanima to Farad'n Corrino   has resulted in Leto's majordomo Moneo Atreides and his daughter Siona. Moneo has served Leto faithfully for the majority of his life   having been a rebel until he was shown the Golden Path in a test by Leto. Siona is the leader of a group of rebels seeking to overthrow the God Emperor   and locate his hidden hoard of melange. Unbeknownst to Siona   Nayla &mdash; her close friend and de facto bodyguard &mdash; worships Leto   and is under orders to protect and obey Siona in all things while reporting on her rebellious activities. Although Leto knows the important purpose of Siona   as long as she doesn't serve the ""Golden Path"" she would be expendable   and he would have to take measures for the breeding paths that he would have to take to replace her. During a raid on his Citadel   Siona and her friends steal   among other things   a series of excerpts from Leto's private journal. Unknown to them   Leto is aware of their activities and allows them to continue. In perusing some of the items and documents stolen from the Citadel   Siona learns that Leto remains capable of love   and plots to use this as a weapon against him. At the same time   the new Ixian ambassador   Hwi Noree   is sent to the court of the God Emperor. Immediately entranced by her beauty   grace   and purity   Leto begins to be tortured by the knowledge that he and Hwi are separated by his continued transformation. For her part   Hwi desires nothing more than to serve the God Emperor   and she quickly becomes a confidante   finally expressing her love of Leto. The latest incarnation of Duncan is also captivated by Hwi's beauty   but is rebuffed by Leto   who warns that Hwi is his alone. Because of his intense feelings for Hwi and the fact that she had never appeared in his prescient visions   Leto realizes that she is a trap   trained and sent by the Ixians to weaken him. However   he is unable to send her away   and she gladly accepts his offer to remain. It is revealed that Hwi had been grown inside an Ixian no-room &mdash; a device that shields its occupants from prescient view &mdash; from cells of a former Ixian ambassador   Malky   who had been a cynical and roguish friend of the God Emperor. Through discussions with Moneo and Leto   Duncan learns about Leto's transformation   the Fish Speakers   and the oppressive measures Leto takes to maintain his absolute control over the Empire. He begins to grow more agitated and restless   though he continues in his duties   defending the God Emperor from an attack by Tleilaxu Face Dancers. Duncan struggles with feelings of inadequacy   and the confusion and disorientation that result from existing in a time alien to him. Duncan meets Siona   and though the two of them are coldly formal to one another   they eventually unite to kill Leto and end his tyrannical rule over mankind. Leto and Hwi decide to marry   and lead a wedding procession from Leto's Little Citadel to Tuono Village   where Duncan and Siona have been sent. While crossing the Idaho River   Siona orders Nayla to cut the supports of the bridge with a lasgun   spilling Moneo   Hwi   Leto   and a number of courtiers into the jagged rocks in the canyon below. Nayla obeys   despite her fanaticism toward the God Emperor   believing that the instructions are a test of her loyalty. Leto survives the fall   but is immersed in water   and his body begins to dissolve   just as did the sandworms of ancient Dune. In a final conversation with Siona and Duncan   Leto reveals that Siona is the embodiment of the Golden Path   a human completely shielded from prescient view. He explains that humanity is now free from the domination of oracles   free to scatter throughout the universe   never again to face complete domination. After revealing the location of his secret spice hoard   Leto dies   leaving Duncan and Siona to face the task of managing the empire."  17  "['Science Fiction'   'Speculative fiction'   ""Children's

more than years his lifespan lengthened due to his decision in children of dune to merge his human body with sandtrout the haploid phase of the giant sandworms of arrakis his continued evolution has slowly transformed him altering his human form into what he calls a pre worm his body has come to resemble a small version of the ancient sandworms of arrakis mdash ribbed elongated and covered in scaly sandtrout his face remains as do his hands and arms but his legs and feet have atrophied to be of no use whatsoever and he moves from place to place on a large cart of ixian manufacture it is later revealed that his brain has gradually diffused into the rest of his body becoming a series of nodes throughout his whole form this distribution of internal organs and his sandtrout skin makes him virtually impervious to harm even allowing him to survive lasgun fire but like a sandworm his biology is very vulnerable to water during his long reign leto has enforced a state of peace throughout his empire both through tight control of his enormous but limited hoard of the spice melange and the military might of his fish speaker army the old imperium is basically non existent the landsraad has ceased to exist and only a few remnants of the great houses survive the bene gesserit and spacing guild have endured although both have been forced to adapt to letos absolute control over melange and his powerful prescience and choam has been reduced to a shadow of its former self his reign is considered by many to be depraved and despotic but he is confident that his actions will ensure the survival of the human race letos enforced peace brings stagnation to the galaxy he himself battles an incessant struggle with boredom and loneliness that overwhelms him because of his everlasting life close to absolute prescience a loss of vulnerability which renders him incapable of physical intimacy and his perception of the passage of time in great lengths as decades may pass without him realizing it few people realize the burden that he carries as he deems subjects useful as long as they serve a purpose to the golden path the end justifying the means leto maintains a small and reclusive system of government and as god he chooses not to share the inner workings and purpose of his decisions or any sympathy for his cause as he knows that humanity would not be able to grasp the concept as his father before him leto is utterly incapable of foreseeing his own demise and concludes that whatever he cannot see and perceive mdash and thus control mdash is connected to his eventual death ironically this amuses him since it is one of the few things that still brings surprise to his otherwise dull existence leto has employed a series of gholas grown from the cells of duncan idaho the faithful swordmaster of house atreides duncan functions both as the captain of letos guard and as a familiar face to calm leto in his moments of distress they remind leto of his family and he feels that he owes duncan for his service and devotion to house atreides the vast majority of these gholas are made under letos instructions of preserving the original idaho without enhancements idahos masterful abilities thus are dwarfed by thousands of years of genetic manipulation displayed by letos servants over the centuries a significant number of the gholas have attempted to assassinate leto through various means after struggling with the conflict between their intense loyalty to house atreides and the moral disgust triggered by the repression and stagnation leto has forced upon the empire these feelings compounded with the uneasy doubt caused by being millennia out of their own time drives some of the duncan idaho gholas insane even when he doesnt ask for a new ghola or considering the circumstances surrounding the previous idahos demise the tleilaxu usually send one anyway as a token for their survival letos golden path as he calls it is a millennia

40  41  12667  Genesis    "{""/m/02mdj1"": ""Religious text""}"  " God creates the world in six days and consecrates the seventh after giving mankind his first commandment: ""be fruitful and multiply"". God pronounces the world ""very good""   but it becomes corrupted by the sin of man and God sends a deluge (a great flood) to destroy it   saving only the righteous (Noah) and his family   from whose seed the world is repopulated. Man sins again   but God has promised that he will not destroy the world a second time with water. God instructs Abram (the future Abraham) to travel from his home in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) to the land of Canaan. There God makes a covenant with Abram promising that his descendants shall be as numerous as the stars in the heavens   but that they shall suffer oppression in a foreign land for four hundred years   after which they shall inherit the land ""from the river of Egypt to the great river   the river Euphrates."" Abram's name is changed to Abraham and that of his wife Sarai to Sarah   and circumcision of all males is instituted as the sign of the covenant. Sarah is barren   and tells Abraham to take her Egyptian handmaiden   Hagar   as a concubine. Through Hagar   Abraham becomes the father of Ishmael. Abraham asks God that Ishmael ""might live in Thy sight  "" (that is   be favored)   but God replies that Sarah will bear a son   who will be named Isaac   through whom the covenant will be established. At Sarah's insistence Ishmael and his mother Hagar are driven out into the wilderness   but God saves them and promises to make Ishmael a great nation. God resolves to destroy the city of Sodom for the sins of its people. Abraham protests that it is not just ""to slay the righteous with the wicked  "" and asks if the whole city can be spared if even ten righteous men are found there. God replies: ""For the sake of ten I will not destroy it."" Abraham's nephew Lot is saved from the destruction of Sodom   and through incest with his daughters becomes the ancestor of the Moabites and Ammonites. God tests Abraham by demanding that he sacrifice Isaac. As Abraham is about to lay the knife upon his son   God restrains him   promising him numberless descendants. On the death of Sarah   Abraham purchases Machpelah (modern Hebron) for a family tomb and sends his servant to Mesopotamia to find among his relations a wife for Isaac   and Rebekah is chosen. Other children are born to Abraham by another wife   Keturah   among whose descendants are the Midianites   and he dies in a prosperous old age and is buried in his tomb at Hebron. Isaac's wife Rebekah is barren   but Isaac prays to God and she gives birth to the twins Esau   father of the Edomites   and Jacob. Through deception   Jacob becomes the heir instead of Esau and gains his father's blessing. He flees to his uncle where he prospers and earns his two wives. Jacob's name is changed to Israel   and by his wives Rachel and Leah and their handmaidens he has twelve sons   the ancestors of the twelve tribes of the Children of Israel. Joseph   Jacob's favourite son   is sold into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers. But Joseph prospers   and when famine comes he brings his father and his brothers and their households   seventy persons in all   to Egypt   where Pharaoh assigns to them the land of Goshen. Jacob calls his sons to his bedside and reveals their future to them before he dies and is interred in the family tomb at Machpelah. Joseph lives to see his great-grandchildren   and on his death-bed he exhorts his brethren   if God should remember them and lead them out of the country   to take his bones with them. The book ends with Joseph's remains being ""put in a coffin in Egypt."""  5  ['Religious text']  god creates the world in six days and consecrates the seventh after giving mankind his first

41  42  12995  Gone with the Wind  Margaret Mitchell  "{""/m/02p0szs"": ""Historical fiction""   ""/m/02xlf"": ""Fiction""   ""/m/05hgj"": ""Novel""}"  " Gone with the Wind takes place in the southern United States in the state of Georgia during the American Civil War (1861â1865) and the Reconstruction Era (1865â1877) that followed the war. The novel unfolds against the backdrop of rebellion wherein seven southern states   Georgia among them   have declared their secession from the United States (the ""Union"") and formed the Confederate States of America (the ""Confederacy"")   after Abraham Lincoln was elected president with no ballots from ten Southern states where slavery was legal. A dispute over states' rights has arisen had an effect on men   especially when she took notice of them. It is the day before the men are called to war   Fort Sumter having been fired on two days earlier. There are brief but vivid descriptions of the South as it began and grew   with backgrounds of the main characters: the stylish and highbrow French   the gentlemanly English   the forced-to-flee and looked-down-upon Irish. Miss Scarlett learns that one of her many beaux   Ashley Wilkes   is soon to be engaged to his cousin   Melanie Hamilton. She is stricken at heart. The following day at the Wilkeses' barbecue at ""Twelve Oaks  "" Scarlett informs Ashley she loves him and Ashley admits he cares for her. However   he knows he would not be happily married to Scarlett because of their personality differences. Scarlett loses her temper at Ashley and he silently takes it. Then Scarlett meets Rhett Butler   a man who has a reputation as a rogue. Rhett had been alone in the library when Ashley and Scarlett entered   and felt it wiser to not make his presence known while the argument took place. Rhett applauds Scarlett for the unladylike spirit she displayed with Ashley. Infuriated and humiliated   Scarlett tells Rhett   ""You aren't fit to wipe Ashley's boots!"" Upon leaving the library and rejoining the other party guests   she finds out that war has been declared and the men are going to enlist. Seeking revenge for being jilted by Ashley   Scarlett accepts a proposal of marriage from Melanie's brother   Charles Hamilton. They marry two weeks later. Charles dies from measles two months after the war begins. Scarlett is pregnant with her first child. A widow at merely sixteen   she gives birth to a boy   Wade Hampton Hamilton   named after his father's general. As a widow   she is bound by tradition to wear black and avoid conversation with young men. Scarlett is despondent as a result of the restrictions placed upon her. Melanie   who is living in Atlanta with Aunt Pittypat   invites Scarlett to live with them. In Atlanta   Scarlett's spirits revive and she is busy with hospital work and sewing circles for the Confederate army. Scarlett encounters Rhett Butler again at a dance for the Confederacy. Although Rhett believes the war is a lost cause   he is blockade running for the profit in it. The men must bid for a dance with a lady and Rhett bids ""one hundred fifty dollars-in gold."" for a dance with Scarlett. Everyone at the dance is shocked that Rhett would bid for Scarlett   the widow still dressed in black. Melanie smooths things over by coming to Rhett's defense because he is generously supporting the Confederate cause for which her husband   Ashley   is fighting. At Christmas (1863)   Ashley has been granted a furlough from the army and returns to Atlanta to be with Melanie. The war is going badly for the Confederacy. Atlanta is under siege (September 1864)   ""hemmed in on three sides  "" it descends into a desperate state while hundreds of wounded Confederate soldiers lie dying or dead in the city. Melanie goes into labor with only the inexperienced Scarlett to assist   as all the doctors are busy attending the soldiers. Prissy   a young Negro servant girl   cries out in despair and fear   ""De Yankees is comin!"" In the chaos   Scarlett   left to fend for herself   cries for the comfort and safety of her mother and Tara. The tattered Confederate States Army sets flame to Atlanta as they abandon it to the Union Army. Melanie gives birth to a boy named ""Beau""   and now they must hurry for refuge. Scarlett tells Prissy to go find Rhett   but she is afraid to ""go runnin' roun' in de dahk"". Scarlett replies to Prissy   ""Haven't you any gumption?"" Prissy then finds Rhett   and Scarlett begs him to take herself   Wade   Melanie   Beau   and Prissy to Tara. Rhett laughs at the idea   but steals an emaciated horse and a small wagon   and they follow the retreating army out of Atlanta. Part way to Tara   Rhett has a change of heart and he abandons Scarlett to enlist in the army. Scarlett makes her way to Tara without him where she is welcomed on the steps by her father   Gerald. It is clear things have drastically changed: Gerald has lost his mind   Scarlett's mother is dead   her sisters are sick with typhoid fever   the field slaves left after Emancipation   the Yankees have burned all the cotton and there is no food in the house. The long tiring struggle for post-war survival begins that has Scarlett working in the fields. There are so many hungry people to feed and so little food. There is the ever present threat of the Yankees who steal and burn   and at one point   Scarlett kills a Yankee marauder with a single shot from Charles's pistol leaving ""a bloody pit where the nose had been."" A long succession of Confederate soldiers returning home stop at Tara to find food and rest. Two men stay on   an invalid Cracker   Will Benteen   and Ashley Wilkes   whose spirit is broken. Life at Tara slowly begins to recover when a new threat appears in the form of new taxes on Tara. Scarlett knows only one man who has enough money to help her pay the taxes   Rhett Butler. She goes to Atlanta to find him only to learn Rhett is in jail. As she is leaving the jailhouse   Scarlett runs into Frank Kennedy   who is betrothed to Scarlett's sister   Suellen   and running a store in Atlanta. Soon realizing Frank also has money   Scarlett hatches a plot and tells Frank that Suellen has changed her mind about marrying him. Thereafter Frank succumbs to Scarlett's feminine charms and he marries her two weeks later knowing he has done ""something romantic and exciting for the first time in his life."" Always wanting Scarlett to be happy and radiant   Frank gives her the money to pay the taxes on Tara. While Frank has a cold and is being pampered by Aunt Pittypat   Scarlett goes over the accounts at Frank's store and finds many of his friends owe him money. Scarlett is now terrified about the taxes and decides money   a lot of it   is needed. She takes control of his business while he is away and her business practices leave many Atlantans resentful of her. Then with a loan from Rhett she buys a sawmill and runs the lumber business herself   all very unladylike conduct. Much to Frank's relief   Scarlett learns she is pregnant   which curtails her activities for awhile. She convinces Ashley to come to Atlanta and manage the mill   all the while still in love with him. At Melanie's urging   Ashley takes the job at the mill. Melanie soon becomes the center of Atlanta society   and Scarlett gives birth to a girl named Ella Lorena. ""Ella for her grandmother Ellen   and Lorena because it was the most fashionable name of the day for girls."" The state of Georgia is under martial law and life there has taken on a new and more frightening tone. For protection   Scarlett keeps Frank's pistol tucked in the upholstery of the buggy. Her trips alone to and from the mill take her past a shanty town where criminal elements live. On one evening when she is coming home from the mill   Scarlett is accosted by two men who attempt to rob her   but she escapes with the help of Big Sam   the former negro foreman from Tara. Attempting to avenge the assault on his wife   Frank and the Ku Klux Klan raid the shanty town whereupon Frank is shot dead. Scarlett is a widow for a second time. Rhett puts on a charade to keep the men who participated in the shanty town raid from being arrested. He walks into the Wilkeses' home with Hugh Elsing and Ashley   singing and pretending to be drunk. Yankee officers outside the home question Rhett and he tells them he and the other men had been at Belle Watling's brothel that evening   a story Belle later confirms to the officers. The men are indebted to Rhett for saving them   and his Scallawag reputation among them improves a notch   but the men's wives   with the exception of Melanie   are livid at owing their husbands' lives to Belle Watling. Frank Kennedy lies cold in a coffin in the quiet stillness of the parlor in Aunt Pittypat's home. Scarlett is in a remorseful state. She is swigging brandy from Aunt Pitty's swoon bottle when Rhett comes to call. She tells Rhett tearfully   ""I'm afraid I'll die and go to hell  "" to which Rhett replies   ""Maybe there isn't a hell."" Before she can cry any further   Rhett asks Scarlett to marry him saying   ""I always intended having you   one way or another."" Scarlett declares she doesn't love him and doesn't want to be married again. However   Rhett kisses her passionately   and in the heat of the moment she agrees to marry him. One year later   Scarlett and Rhett announce their engagement. News of the impending marriage is the talk of the town. Mr. and Mrs. Butler honeymoon in New Orleans   spending lavishly. Upon their return to Atlanta   the couple take up residence in the bridal suite at the National Hotel while their new home on Peachtree Street is being constructed. Scarlett chooses a modern Swiss chalet style home like the one she saw in Harper's Weekly   and red wallpaper   thick red carpet and black walnut furniture for the interior. Rhett describes the house as an ""architectural horror"". Shortly after the Butlers move into their new home   the sardonic jabs between them turn into full-blown quarrels. Scarlett wonders why Rhett married her. Then ""with real hate in her eyes"" she tells Rhett she is going to have a baby   a baby she does not want. Wade is seven years old in 1869 when his sister   Eugenie Victoria   named after two queens   arrives in the world. She has blue eyes like Gerald O'Hara and Melanie gives her the nickname   ""Bonnie Blue  "" in reference to the Bonnie Blue Flag of the Confederacy. When Scarlett is feeling well again   she makes a trip to the mill and talks to Ashley   who is alone in the office. In the conversation with him   she comes away believing Ashley still loves her and is jealous of her intimate relations with Rhett   which excites her. Scarlett returns home and tells Rhett she does not want more children. From then on   Scarlett and Rhett sleep in separate bedrooms   and when Bonnie is two years old   she sleeps in a little bed beside Rhett's bed (with the light on all night long because she is afraid of the dark). Rhett turns his attention towards Bonnie   dotes on her   spoils her   and worries about her reputation when she is older. Melanie is giving a surprise birthday party for Ashley. Scarlett goes to the mill to keep Ashley there until party time   a rare opportunity for Scarlett to see Ashley alone. When she sees him   she feels ""sixteen again   a little breathless and excited."" Ashley tells her how pretty she looks   and they reminisce about the days when they were young and talk about their lives now. Suddenly Scarlett's eyes fill with tears and Ashley holds her head against his chest. Then in the doorway of the office Ashley sees standing his sister   India Wilkes. Before the party has even begun rumors of an adulterous relationship between Ashley and Scarlett have started   and Rhett and Melanie have heard the gossip. Melanie refuses to accept any criticism of her sister in-law and India Wilkes is banished from the Wilkeses' home for it   causing a rift in the family. Rhett   more drunk than Scarlett has ever seen him   returns home the evening of the party long after Scarlett. His eyes are bloodshot and his mood is dark and violent. He enjoins Scarlett to drink with him. Not wanting Rhett to know she is fearful of him   Scarlett throws back a drink and gets up from her chair to go back to her bedroom. But Rhett stops her and pins her shoulders to the wall. Scarlett tells Rhett he is jealous of Ashley and Rhett accuses Scarlett of ""crying for the moon"" over Ashley. He tells Scarlett they could have been happy together saying   ""for I loved you and I know you."" Rhett then takes Scarlett in his arms and carries her up the stairs to her bedroom where passion envelops them. The following morning Rhett leaves town with Bonnie and Prissy and stays away for three months. Scarlett finds herself missing him   but she is still unsure if Rhett loves her   having told her so when he was drunk. She learns she is pregnant with her fourth child. On the day Rhett arrives home   Scarlett waits for him at the top of the stairs. She wonders if Rhett will kiss her   but to Scarlett's irritation   he does not. He tells her she looks pale. Scarlett tells him she is pale because she is pregnant. Rhett sarcastically asks her if the father is Ashley. She calls Rhett a cad and tells him no woman would want a baby of his. To which Rhett responds   ""cheer up   maybe you'll have a miscarriage."" At that comment   Scarlett lunges at Rhett   but he side steps and she tumbles backwards down the stairs. She is seriously ill for the first time in her life   having lost her child and broken her ribs. Rhett is remorseful   believing he has killed her. Sobbing and drunk   Rhett buries his head in Melanie's lap and confesses he had been a jealous cad. Scarlett   who is thin and pale   goes to Tara taking Wade and Ella with her   to regain her strength and vitality from ""the green cotton fields of home."" When she returns a healthy woman to Atlanta   she sells the mills to Ashley. She finds Rhett's attitude has noticeably changed. He is sober   kinder   polite and seemingly disinterested. Though she misses the old Rhett at times   Scarlett is content to leave well enough alone. Now Bonnie is four years old in 1873. A spirited and willful child   she has her father wrapped around her finger and giving into her every demand. Even Scarlett is jealous of the attention she gets from him. Rhett rides his horse around town with Bonnie in front of him   but the household mammy   ""Mammy  "" insists it is not fitting for a girl to ride a horse with her dress flying up. Rhett heeds Mammy's words and buys Bonnie a Shetland pony   whom she names ""Mr. Butler  "" and teaches her to ride sidesaddle. Then Rhett pays a boy named Wash twenty-five cents to teach Mr. Butler to jump over wood bars. When Mr. Butler is able to get his fat legs over a one foot high bar   Rhett puts Bonnie on the pony   and soon Mr. Butler is leaping bars and Aunt Melly's rose bushes. Wearing her blue velvet riding habit with a red feather in her black hat   Bonnie pleads with her father to raise the bar to one and a half feet. He gives in and raises the bar   warning her not to come crying to him if she falls. Bonnie yells to her Mother   ""Watch me take this one!"" The pony gallops towards the wood bar   but trips over it splintering the wood. Mr. Butler tumbles to the ground then scrambles to his feet and trots off with an empty saddle. Little Miss ""Bonnie Blue"" Butler is dead. In the dark days and months following Bonnie's death   Rhett is often drunk and disheveled   while Scarlett   though deeply grieved also   seems to hold up under the strain. With the untimely death of Melanie Wilkes a short time later   Rhett decides he only wants the calm dignity of the genial South he once knew in his youth and he leaves Atlanta to find it. Meanwhile   Scarlett dreams of love that has eluded her for so long. However   she still has Tara and is determined to win Rhett back   and ""tomorrow is another day."""  16  "['Historical fiction'   'Fiction'   'Novel']"  gone with the wind takes place in the southern

42  43  13535  Heart of Darkness  Joseph Conrad  "{""/m/02xlf"": ""Fiction""   ""/m/0l67h"": ""Novella""   ""/m/016lj8"": ""Roman \u00e0 clef""}"  " 'Heart of Darkness' opens in first person narrative; our narrator establishes the setting aboard a sailboat   ""The Nellie   a cruising yawl  "" anchored in the Thames River near Gravesend (England). It is somewhat hazy and late in the day. Aboard are four others: the Director of Companies (the captain)   the Lawyer (""the best of old fellows"")   the Accountant (toying architecturally with dominoes)   and Marlow (Charlie Marlow) - all share ""the bond of the sea"" but Marlow is the only one that still ""followed the sea"" - they are waiting for the tide waters to turn. Some undefined conversation is shared lazily   the sun sets; then Marlow states how their location also ""has been one of the dark places of the earth."" Marlow continues describing the trials and tribulations that must have been encountered by the first Romans who made their way to England; how mysterious and incomprehensible the place must have seemed to them. He also explains how brutal and unscrupulous these Romans must have been: ""They were conquerors   and for that you want only brute force"" - After some silence   Marlow abruptly starts up again saying   in a hesitating voice   ""I suppose you fellows remember I did once turn fresh-water sailor for a bit."" Marlow introduces the events that led to his appointment to captain a river-steamboat for an ivory trading company. He describes his passage on ships to the wilderness - to the Company's station   which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation: ""amongst a waste of excavations"" - disorganized   machinery parts here and there   now and then explosions of demolition   weakened native black men   that have been demoralized   in chains   literally being worked to death   and strolling behind them a white Company man in a uniform carrying a rifle. Marlow remarks on these Company men: ""I've seen the devil of violence   and the devil of greed   and the devil of hot desire; but   by all the stars! these were strong   lusty   red-eyed devils   that swayed and drove menâmen   I tell you. But as I stood on this hillside   I foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land I would become acquainted with a flabby   pretending   weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly. How insidious he could be   too   I was only to find out several months later and a thousand miles farther."" At this station Marlow meets the Company's chief accountant   who's dressed in ""unexpected elegance"" - ""Everything else in the station was in a muddle"" - Marlow first hears of a Mr. Kurtz from the chief accountant   who explains that Kurtz is a first-class agent   and later adds: ""'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They   aboveâthe Council in Europe   you knowâmean him to be.'"" Marlow leaves that station with a caravan to travel on foot some two hundred miles deeper into the wilderness - to the Central Station   where his steamboat is based - the steamer he is to captain. Upon arrival at the Central Station: ""the first glance at the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running that show."" Marlow is shocked to learn that his steamboat had been wrecked two days before his arrival. The manager explains to Marlow that they couldn't wait   and needed to take the steamboat up-river because of ""rumours that a very important station was in jeopardy   and its chief   Mr. Kurtz   was ill."" Marlow describes that the manager ""inspired uneasiness"" - ""just uneasinessânothing more"" - Along with the manager   Marlow describes the other Company men at this station as lazy back-biting ""pilgrims"" - fraught with envy and jealousy. All trying to better position themselves in a way to acquire a higher status within the Company   which in turn   would carry more personal profit; but sought after such goals in a meaningless ineffective lazy manner   mixed with a sense that they were all merely waiting   while trying to stay out of harm's way. After fishing his command out of the river   frustrations are met during the months spent on repairs. During this time   Marlow learns that at this station Mr. Kurtz is far from being admired   but instead   more or less   Kurtz is resented (mostly by the manager). Not only is Kurtz's position at the Inner Station a highly envied position   but sentiment seems to be that Kurtz is not deserving of it   as Kurtz only received the appointment by his connections back in Europe. Once ready and underway   the journey up-river to the Inner Station   Kurtz's station   takes two months - to the day. On board was the manager   three or four ""pilgrims"" and about twenty ""cannibals"" that were enlisted to crew the steamer. Marlow describes the brooding wilderness   in all its glory   and in all its mystery. Here and there would be a Company post where Company agents seemed imprisoned   captive by the business of ivory; now and then on shore an occasional native village would be seen   with a frenzied uproar by the natives. Marlow expresses a greater enthusiasm towards the idea of meeting Kurtz - but things become more tense as they get closer to his station. They come to rest for the night about eight miles below the Inner Station. In the morning they awake only to find that they are immersed within a thick white fog. From the river bank they hear a very loud cry   followed by a complaining clamour in savage discords: ""It culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking   which stopped short"" - ""The sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap."" Many wondered if there would be an attack. But it was not until a few hours onwards   while safe navigation was becoming increasingly difficult   that the steamboat was hit with a barrage of sticks - little arrows   everywhere - aimed at the steamboat from the wilderness on shore. The little arrows ""looked as though they wouldn't kill a cat"" - The pilgrims with their Winchesters had opened fire into the bush. The native who had been serving as helmsman   gave up steering to pick up a rifle and shoot it. Marlow grabs the wheel to avoid snags in the river. The helmsman fell at Marlow's feet clutching a shaft of a spear   which had entered his body just below the ribs. Marlow began to screech the steam whistle repeatedly; ""the shower of arrows stopped   a few dropping shots rang out sharplyâthen silence"" - A pilgrim in ""pink pyjamas"" arrives at the pilot-house   and is shocked to see the dying helmsman. They watch the helmsman die with an inexplicable expression on his face. Marlow forces the pilgrim in ""pink pyjamas"" to take the wheel so that he can shed his blood soaked shoes   and while flinging the pair overboard   he is hit with a rush of thoughts; thinking he would never have a chance to hear Kurtz talk   as he is most likely dead - then submits: ""Of course I was wrong. The privilege was waiting for me. Oh   yes   I heard more than enough."" Marlow makes a vague mention of a girl   whom later Kurtz will refer to as ""My Intended"" (his fiancÃ©e): ""You should have heard him say   'My ivory.' Oh   yes   I heard him. 'My Intended   my ivory   my station   my river   myâ' everything belonged to him."" Marlow reflects more on Kurtz: ""His mother was half-English   his father was half-French. All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz"" - ""I learned that   most appropriately   the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had entrusted him with the making of a report   for its future guidance. And he had written it   too. I've seen it. I've read it. It was eloquent   vibrating with eloquence"" - ""There were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases   unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page   scrawled evidently much later   in an unsteady hand   may be regarded as the exposition of a method. It was very simple   and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you   luminous and terrifying   like a flash of lightning in a serene sky: 'Exterminate all the brutes!' The curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum   because   later on   when he in a sense came to himself   he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of 'my pamphlet' (he called it)   as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career."" After reflecting more on Kurtz   Marlow states ""I can't forget him   though I am not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him. I missed my late helmsman awfully"" - ""don't you see   he had done something   he had steered"" - ""and thus a subtle bond had been created   of which I only became aware when it was suddenly broken."" After putting on a pair of slippers   Marlow returned to the pilot-house and resumed steering. By this time the manager is there   and expresses a strong desire to turn back - right at the moment that the Inner Station comes into view. At Kurtz's station Marlow sees a man on the river-bank waving his arm   urging them to land. Because of his expressions   gestures   and all the colorful patches on his clothing   the man reminds Marlow of a harlequin. The pilgrims   heavily armed   escort the manager on shore to retrieve Mr. Kurtz. The harlequin-like chap boards the steamboat. It turns out the man is Russian   and he is a mere wanderer; who just happened to wander into Kurtz's camp: ""He rattled away at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me. He seemed to be trying to make up for lots of silence   and actually hinted   laughing   that such was the case. 'Don't you talk with Mr. Kurtz?' I said. 'You don't talk with that manâyou listen to him  ' he exclaimed with severe exaltation."" - ""'I tell you  ' he cried   'this man has enlarged my mind.'"" Through conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz could be   how the natives worshiped Kurtz   and how very ill Kurtz has been of late. The concerned harlequin-like Russian admires Mr. Kurtz for his intellect - for his insights - into love   life   and justice. The Russian seems to even admire Kurtz for his power - and his willingness to use it. Marlow suggests that Kurtz has gone mad   and the Russian ""protested indignantly. Mr. Kurtz couldn't be mad. If I had heard him talk   only two days ago   I wouldn't dare hint at such a thing."" From the steamboat   through a glass (telescope) Marlow can observe details of the station   and is surprised suddenly to see near the station house a row of posts with decapitated heads of natives mounted atop of each. Around the corner of the house the manager with the pilgrims appeared   bearing Kurtz on an improvised stretcher. The area then filled with natives   who appeared to be ready for battle. The Russian stated: ""'Now   if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for'"" - On the stretcher Marlow could see Kurtz shouting. The pilgrims carried Kurtz to the steamer and laid him down in one of the little cabins. A gorgeous native woman   with a desperate aspect   walked in measured steps along the shore and stopped right next to the steamer. She raised her arms above her head - then ""turned away slowly   walked on   following the bank   and passed into the bushes."" From the steamboat's cabin Kurtz was placed in   he is heard yelling at the manager: ""'Save me!âsave the ivory   you mean. Don't tell me. Save me! Why   I've had to save you. You are interrupting my plans now. Sick! Sick! Not so sick as you would like to believe.'"" The manager walks out of the cabin   and spoke with Marlow about ""unsound methods"" and Marlow puts forward the notion: ""No method at all"" - After some more words the manager gives Marlow a heavy glance   then leaves. The Russian mentions ""'matters that would affect Mr. Kurtz's reputation.'"" - Marlow replied to the Russian: ""'Mr. Kurtz's reputation is safe with me.'"" - He informed Marlow ""that it was Kurtz who had ordered the attack to be made on the steamer"" - The harlequin-like Russian refers to a canoe waiting for him   and adds: ""'Ah! I'll never   never meet such a man again. You ought to have heard him recite poetryâhis own   too   it was   he told me. Poetry!' He rolled his eyes at the recollection of these delights. 'Oh   he enlarged my mind!' 'Good-bye  ' said I. He shook hands and vanished in the night."" Later   after midnight   Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin - he has left the steamer   and has returned to shore. Marlow goes ashore and finds Kurtz in a very weak state making his way back to his station - but not so weak   as he can still call out to the natives. Marlow appreciates the serious situation he is in   and when Kurtz begins a threatening tone   Marlow interjects that his ""success in Europe is assured in any case"" - Kurtz agrees to allow Marlow to help him back to the steamer. The next day they prepare for their departure. They carried Kurtz to the pilot-house: ""there was more air there"" - The natives once again assembled on shore   and the native woman returned - they all began to shout. Marlow saw the pilgrims getting their rifles ready - so he screeched the steam whistle time after time to scatter the crowd on shore. Only the woman remained unmoved   with outstretched arms. The pilgrims opened fire. The current was swift as they headed downstream. Kurtz's health was worsening. Marlow himself is becoming increasingly ill. The steamboat broke down and repairs needed to be made. Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers with a photograph because of his dislike and mistrust of the manager. While ill   Marlow continued to make the repairs to the steamer: ""I toiled wearily in a wretched scrap-heapâunless I had the shakes too bad to stand."" He did not have much time for Kurtz: ""One evening coming in with a candle I was startled to hear him say a little tremulously   'I am lying here in the dark waiting for death.' The light was within a foot of his eyes. I forced myself to murmur   'Oh   nonsense!' and stood over him as if transfixed."" As Kurtz dies   Marlow hears him whisper   in no more than a breath: ""'The horror! The horror!'"" Marlow blew out the candle   and tries to act like nothing has happened when he joins the other pilgrims   who were all in the mess-room dining with the manager. In a short while   the ""manager's boy"" appears and announces in a scathing tone: ""'Mistah Kurtzâhe dead.'"" - Next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury ""something"" in a muddy hole. ""And then they very nearly buried me"" - Marlow falls very sick   near death himself: ""I have wrestled with death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine"" - ""I was within a hair's breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement   and I found with humiliation that probably I would have nothing to say. This is the reason why I affirm that Kurtz was a remarkable man. He had something to say. He said it. Since I had peeped over the edge myself   I understand better"" - ""He had summed upâhe had judged. 'The horror!' He was a remarkable man. After all   this was the expression of some sort of belief; it had candour   it had conviction   it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper   it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truthâthe strange commingling of desire and hate"" - ""he had made that last stride   he had stepped over the edge   while I had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot. And perhaps in this is the whole difference; perhaps all the wisdom   and all truth   and all sincerity   are just compressed into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible. Perhaps! I like to think my summing-up would not have been a word of careless contempt. Better his cryâmuch better."" Upon Marlow's return to Europe he seems embittered. The everyday life of the Europeans seem to be something a sham - like some sort of hoax. Eventually Marlow took care of the bundle of papers Kurtz had entrusted to him. To a clean-shaven man who had an official manner   Marlow gave the paper entitled 'Suppression of Savage Customs' - ""with the postscriptum torn off"" - To another   who claims to be Kurtz's cousin   Marlow gave family letters and memoranda of no importance. To a journalist he gave a Report for publication   if the journalist saw fit. Finally Marlow was left with some personal letters and the photograph of the girl's portrait - Kurtz's fiancÃ©e   his intended. At her door   even before Marlow entered her house   memories of Kurtz began to flow   along with the final words that he whispered. The girl came forward   dressed in black   and met Marlow in a drawing-room. Although it has been more than a year since Kurtz died   she was still in mourning. It was late   and the room was growing darker. The final words of Kurtz's seemed to echo in the room with the girl. Marlow envisioned them together: ""I saw her and him in the same instant of timeâhis death and her sorrowâI saw her sorrow in the very moment of his death."" She presses Marlow for information   ultimately asking him to repeat the final words Kurtz had spoken. Being very uncomfortable Marlow tells her that the final words that Kurtz pronounce was her name. Marlow was surprised by her reaction: ""I heard a light sigh and then my heart stood still   stopped dead short by an exulting and terrible cry   by the cry of inconceivable triumph and of unspeakable pain. 'I knew itâI was sure!'... She knew. She was sure. I heard her weeping"" - ""I wonder   if I had rendered Kurtz that justice which was his due? Hadn't he said he wanted only justice? But I couldn't. I could not tell her. It would have been too darkâtoo dark altogether...."" Then Marlow and his listeners were silent; our first narrator explains: ""Nobody moved for a time. 'We have lost the first of the ebb  ' said the Director suddenly. I raised my head. The offing was barred by a black bank of clouds   and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed sombre under an overcast skyâseemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness."""  15  "['Fiction'   'Novella'   'Roman Ã  clef']"  heart of darkness opens in first person narrative our narrator establishes the setting aboard a sailboat the nellie a cruising yawl

just below the ribs marlow began to screech the steam whistle repeatedly the shower of arrows stopped a few dropping shots rang out sharply then silence a pilgrim in pink pyjamas arrives at the pilot house and is shocked to see the dying helmsman they watch the helmsman die with an inexplicable expression on his face marlow forces the pilgrim in pink pyjamas to take the wheel so that he can shed his blood soaked shoes and while flinging the pair overboard he is hit with a rush of thoughts thinking he would never have a chance to hear kurtz talk as he is most likely dead then submits of course i was wrong the privilege was waiting for me oh yes i heard more than enough marlow makes a vague mention of a girl whom later kurtz will refer to as my intended his fianc e you should have heard him say my ivory oh yes i heard him my intended my ivory my station my river my everything belonged to him marlow reflects more on kurtz his mother was half english his father was half french all europe contributed to the making of kurtz i learned that most appropriately the international society for the suppression of savage customs had entrusted him with the making of a report for its future guidance and he had written it too ive seen it ive read it it was eloquent vibrating with eloquence there were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page scrawled evidently much later in an unsteady hand may be regarded as the exposition of a method it was very simple and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you luminous and terrifying like a flash of lightning in a serene sky exterminate all the brutes the curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum because later on when he in a sense came to himself he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of my pamphlet he called it as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career after reflecting more on kurtz marlow states i cant forget him though i am not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him i missed my late helmsman awfully dont you see he had done something he had steered and thus a subtle bond had been created of which i only became aware when it was suddenly broken after putting on a pair of slippers marlow returned to the pilot house and resumed steering by this time the manager is there and expresses a strong desire to turn back right at the moment that the inner station comes into view at kurtzs station marlow sees a man on the river bank waving his arm urging them to land because of his expressions gestures and all the colorful patches on his clothing the man reminds marlow of a harlequin the pilgrims heavily armed escort the manager on shore to retrieve mr kurtz the harlequin like chap boards the steamboat it turns out the man is russian and he is a mere wanderer who just happened to wander into kurtzs camp he rattled away at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me he seemed to be trying to make up for lots of silence and actually hinted laughing that such was the case dont you talk with mr kurtz i said you dont talk with that man you listen to him he exclaimed with severe exaltation i tell you he cried this man has enlarged my mind through conversation marlow discovers just how wanton kurtz could be how the natives worshiped kurtz and how very ill kurtz has been of late the concerned harlequin like russian admires mr kurtz for his intellect for his insights into love life and justice the russian seems to even admire kurtz for his power and his willingness to use it marlow suggests that kurtz has gone mad and the russian protested indignantly mr kurtz couldnt be mad if i had heard him talk only two days ago i wouldnt dare hint at such a thing from the steamboat through a glass telescope marlow can observe details of the station and is surprised suddenly to see near the station house a row of posts with decapitated heads of natives mounted atop of each around the corner of the house the manager with the pilgrims appeared bearing kurtz on an improvised stretcher the area then filled with natives who appeared to be ready for battle the russian stated now if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for on the stretcher marlow could see kurtz shouting the pilgrims carried kurtz to the steamer and laid him down in one of the little cabins a gorgeous native woman with a desperate aspect walked in measured steps along the shore and stopped right next to the steamer she raised her arms above her head then turned away slowly walked on following the bank and passed into the bushes from the steamboats cabin kurtz was placed in he is heard yelling at the manager save me save the ivory you mean dont tell me save me why ive had to save you you are interrupting my plans now sick sick not so sick as you would like to believe the manager walks out of the cabin and spoke with marlow about unsound methods and marlow puts forward the notion no method at all after some more words the manager gives marlow a heavy glance then leaves the russian mentions matters that would affect mr kurtzs reputation marlow replied to the russian mr kurtzs reputation is safe with me he informed marlow that it was kurtz who had ordered the attack to be made on the steamer the harlequin like russian refers to a canoe waiting for him and adds ah ill never never meet such a man again you ought to have heard him recite poetry his own too it was he told me poetry he rolled his eyes at the recollection of these delights oh he enlarged my mind good bye said i he shook hands and vanished in the night later after midnight marlow discovers that kurtz has left his cabin he has left the steamer and has returned to shore marlow goes ashore and finds kurtz in a very weak state making his way back to his station but not so weak as he can still call out to the natives marlow appreciates the serious situation he is in and when kurtz begins a threatening tone marlow interjects that his success in europe is assured in any case kurtz agrees to allow marlow to help him back to the steamer the next day they prepare for their departure they carried kurtz to the pilot house there was more air there the natives once again assembled on shore and the native woman returned they all began to shout marlow saw the pilgrims getting their rifles ready so he screeched the steam whistle time after time to scatter the crowd on shore only the woman remained unmoved with outstretched arms the pilgrims opened fire the current was swift as they headed downstream kurtzs health was worsening marlow himself is becoming increasingly ill the steamboat broke down and repairs needed to be made kurtz gives marlow a packet of papers with a photograph because of his dislike and mistrust of the manager while ill marlow continued to make the repairs to the steamer i toiled wearily in a wretched scrap heap unless i had the shakes too bad to stand he did not have much time for kurtz one evening coming in with a candle i was startled to hear him say a little tremulously i am lying here in the dark waiting for death the light was within a foot of his eyes i forced myself to murmur oh nonsense and stood over him as if transfixed as kurtz dies marlow hears him whisper in no more than a breath the horror the horror marlow blew out the candle and tries to act like nothing has happened when he joins the other pilgrims who were all in the mess room dining with the manager in a short while the managers boy appears and announces in a scathing tone mistah kurtz he dead next day marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury something in a muddy hole and then they very nearly buried me marlow falls very sick near death himself i have wrestled with death it is the most unexciting contest you can imagine i was within a hairs breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement and i found with humiliation that probably i would have nothing to say this is the reason why i affirm that kurtz was a remarkable man he had something to say he said it since i had peeped over the edge myself i understand better he had summed up he had judged the horror he was a remarkable man after all this was the expression of some sort of belief it had candour it had conviction it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth the strange commingling of desire and hate he had made that last stride he had stepped over the edge while i had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot and perhaps in this is the whole difference perhaps all the wisdom and all truth and all sincerity are just compressed into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible perhaps i like to think my summing up would not have been a word of careless contempt better his cry much better upon marlows return to europe he seems embittered the everyday life of the europeans seem to be something a sham like some sort of hoax eventually marlow took care of the bundle of papers kurtz had entrusted to him to a clean shaven man who had an official manner marlow gave the paper entitled suppression of savage customs with the postscriptum torn off to another who claims to be kurtzs cousin marlow gave family letters and memoranda of no importance to a journalist he gave a report for publication if the journalist saw fit finally marlow was left with some personal letters and the photograph of the girls portrait kurtzs fianc e his intended at her door even before marlow entered her house memories of kurtz began to flow along with the final words that he whispered the girl came forward dressed in black and met marlow in a drawing room although it has been more than a year since kurtz died she was still in mourning it was late and the room was growing darker the final words of kurtzs seemed to echo in the room with the girl marlow envisioned them together i saw her and him in the same instant of time his death and her sorrow i saw her sorrow in the very moment of his death she presses marlow for information ultimately asking him to repeat the final words kurtz had spoken being very uncomfortable marlow tells her that the final words that kurtz pronounce was her name marlow was surprised by her reaction i heard a light sigh and then my heart stood still stopped dead short by an exulting and terrible cry by the cry of inconceivable triumph and of unspeakable pain i knew it i was sure she knew she was sure i heard her weeping i wonder if i had rendered kurtz that justice which was his due hadnt he said he wanted only justice but i couldnt i could not tell her it would have been too dark too dark altogether then marlow and his listeners were silent our first narrator explains nobody moved for a time we have lost the first of the ebb said the director suddenly i raised my head the offing was barred by a black bank of clouds and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed sombre under an overcast sky seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness Joseph Conrad Fiction Novella Roman Ã  clef

Sandworms have reappeared on Arrakis (now called Rakis) and renewed the flow of the all-important spice melange to the galaxy. With Leto's death   a hugely complex economic system built on spice collapsed   resulting in trillions leaving known space in a great Scattering. A new civilization has risen   with three dominant powers: the Ixians   whose no-ships are capable of piloting between the stars and are invisible to outside detection; the Bene Tleilax   who have learned to manufacture spice in their axlotl tanks and have created a new breed of Face Dancers; and the Bene Gesserit   a matriarchal order of subtle political manipulators who possess superhuman abilities. However   people from the Scattering are returning with their own peculiar powers. The most powerful of these forces are the Honored Matres   a violent society of women bred and trained for combat and the sexual control of men. On Rakis   a girl called Sheeana has been discovered who can control the giant worms. The Bene Gesserit intends to use a Tleilaxu-provided Duncan Idaho ghola to gain control of this sandrider   and the religious forces of mankind who they know will ultimately worship her. The Sisterhood have subtly been altering the gholas to bring their physical reflexes up to modern standards. The Bene Gesserit leader   Mother Superior Taraza   brings Miles Teg to guard the new Idaho. Taraza also sends Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade to take command of the Bene Gesserit keep on Rakis. Odrade is a loose cannon; she does not obey normal Bene Gesserit prohibitions about love   and is also Teg's biological daughter. Bene Gesserit Imprinter Lucilla is also sent by Taraza to bind Idaho's loyalty to the Sisterhood with her sexual talents. However   Lucilla must deal with Reverend Mother Schwangyu   head of the ghola project but also the leader of a faction within the Bene Gesserit who feel gholas are a danger. Above the planet Gammu   Taraza is captured and held hostage by the Honored Matres aboard an Ixian no-ship. The Honored Matres insist Taraza invite Teg to the ship   hoping to gain control of the ghola project. Teg manages to turn the tables on the Matres   and rescues the Mother Superior and her party. An attack is then made on Sheeana on Rakis   which is prevented by the intervention of the Bene Gesserit. Odrade starts training Sheeana as a Bene Gesserit. At about the same time an attempt is made on the life of Idaho   but Teg is able to defeat it. Teg flees with Duncan and Lucilla into the countryside. In an ancient Harkonnen no-globe   Teg proceeds to awaken Idaho's original memories   but does so before Lucilla can imprint Duncan and thus tie him to the Sisterhood. In the meantime   Taraza has been searching for Teg and his party   and finally establishes contact. During the operation   however   Teg and his companions are ambushed. Teg is captured while Lucilla and Duncan escape. Teg is tortured by a T-Probe   but under pressure discovers a new ability: he is able to speed up his physical and mental reactions   which enables him to escape. At the same time   Idaho is ambushed and taken hostage. Taraza arranges a meeting with the Tleilaxu Master Waff   who is soon forced to tell her what he knows about the Honored Matres. When pressed on the issue of Idaho   he also admits that the Bene Tleilax have conditioned their own agenda into him. As the meeting draws to a close   Taraza accidentally divines that Waff is a Zensunni   giving the Bene Gesserit a lever to understand their ancient competitor. She and Odrade meet Waff again on Rakis. He tries to assassinate Taraza but Odrade convinces him that the Sisterhood shares the religious beliefs of the Bene Tleilax. Taraza offers full alliance with them against the onslaught of forces out of the Scattering. This agreement causes consternation among the Bene Gesserit   but Odrade realizes that Taraza's plan is to destroy Rakis. By destroying the planet   the Bene Gesserit would be dependent on the Tleilaxu for the spice   ensuring an alliance. Lucilla arrives at a Bene Gesserit safe house to discover it has been taken over by Honored Matres   who have Idaho as their captive. As Lucilla infiltrates it   the young Honored Matre Murbella proceeds to seduce the captured Idaho with the Honored Matre imprinting method. However   hidden Tleilaxu conditioning kicks in   and Duncan responds with an equal technique   one that overwhelms Murbella. Lucilla takes advantage of Murbella's exhaustion to knock her unconscious and rescue Duncan. The Honored Matres attack Rakis   killing Taraza. Odrade becomes temporary leader of the Bene Gesserit before escaping with Sheeana into the desert on a worm. Teg also goes to a supposed safe house   only to discover the Honored Matres. He unleashes himself upon the complex   before capturing a no-ship and locating Duncan and Lucilla. They and the captured Murbella are taken to Rakis with him. When they arrive   Teg finds Odrade and Sheeana and their giant worm. He loads them all up in his no-ship   finally leading his troops out on a last suicidal defense of Rakis   designed to attract the rage of the Honored Matres. The Honored Matres attack Rakis   destroying the planet and the sandworms except for the one the Bene Gesserit escape with. They drown the worm in a mixture of water and spice   turning it into sandtrout which will turn the secret Bene Gesserit planet Chapterhouse into another Dune."  16  "['Science Fiction'   'Speculative

45  46  14311  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  Mark Twain  "{""/m/06nbt"": ""Satire""   ""/m/0dwly"": ""Children's literature""   ""/m/02xlf"": ""Fiction""   ""/m/08sdrw"": ""Adventure novel""   ""/m/09kqc"": ""Humour""}"  " The story begins in fictional St. Petersburg   Missouri   on the shore of the Mississippi River   sometime between 1835 (when the first steamboat sailed down the Mississippi) and 1845. Two young boys   Thomas ""Tom"" Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn   have each come into a considerable sum of money as a result of their earlier adventures (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer). Huck has been placed under the guardianship of the Widow Douglas   who   together with her sister   Miss Watson   is attempting to civilize him. Huck appreciates their efforts   but finds civilized life confining. His spirits are raised somewhat when Tom Sawyer helps him to escape one night past Miss Watson's slave Jim   to meet up with his gang of self-proclaimed ""robbers"". However   when the gang's exploits turn out to be nothing worse than disrupting Sunday School outings and stealing paltry items like hymn books (which the Sunday School teacher forces them to return anyway)   Huck is again downcast. However   his life is changed by the sudden reappearance of his shiftless father ""Pap""   an abusive parent and drunkard. Although Huck is successful in preventing him from acquiring his fortune (he gives all 6  000 dollars to Judge Thatcher)   Pap forcibly gains custody of him and moves him to his backwoods cabin. Though Huck prefers this to his life with the widow   he resents his father's drunken violence and his habit of keeping him locked inside the cabin. During one of his father's absences Huck escapes   elaborately fakes his own murder   and sets off down the Mississippi River. While living quite comfortably in the wilderness along the Mississippi   Huck encounters Miss Watson's slave Jim on an island called Jackson's Island. Huck learns that Jim has also run away after he overheard Miss Watson's plan to sell Jim downriver   where conditions for slaves were even harsher   because he would bring a price of $800. Jim is trying to make his way to Cairo   Illinois   and then to Ohio   a free state   so that he can buy his family's freedom. At first   Huck is conflicted over whether to tell someone about Jim's running away   but as they travel together and talk in depth   Huck begins to know more about Jim's past and his difficult life. As these conversations continue   Huck begins to change his opinion about people   slavery   and life in general. This continues throughout the rest of the novel. Huck and Jim take up in a cavern on a hill on Jackson's Island to wait out a storm. When they can   they scrounge around the river looking for food   wood   and other items. One night   they find a raft they will eventually use to travel down the Mississippi. Later   they find an entire house floating down the river and enter it to grab what they can. Entering one room   Jim finds a man lying dead on the floor   shot in the back while apparently trying to ransack the house. Jim refuses to let Huck see the man's face. To find out the latest news in the area   Huck dresses as a girl and goes into town. He enters the house of a woman new to the area   thinking she will not recognize him. Huck learns from her that opinion is divided about the ""murder"": while some believe Pap has killed his son in order to inherit his fortune   others blame the runaway Jim. Either way there is a $300 reward for Jim's capture   and a manhunt is already underway   including her husband and another man. The men are going to Jackson's Island at night with a gun. The woman becomes suspicious when Huck threads a needle incorrectly   and her suspicions are confirmed after she puts Huck through a series of tests. Having tricked him into revealing he is a boy   she nevertheless allows him to leave her home   believing him to be a mistreated apprentice on the run. Huck returns quickly to the island where he tells Jim of the impending danger. The two immediately load up the raft and leave the islands. Huck and Jim's raft is swamped by a passing steamship   separating the two. Huck is given shelter by the Grangerfords   a prosperous local family. He becomes friends with Buck Grangerford   a boy about his age   and learns that the Grangerfords are engaged in a 30-year blood feud against another family   the Shepherdsons. The Grangerfords and Shepherdsons go to church. Both families bring guns to continue the show   despite the church's preachings on brotherly love. The vendetta comes to a head when Buck's sister   Sophia Grangerford   elopes with Harney Shepherdson. In the resulting conflict   all the Grangerford males from this branch of the family are shot and killed   although Grangerfords elsewhere survive to carry on the feud. Upon seeing Buck's corpse   Huck is too devastated to write about everything that happened. However   Huck does describe how he narrowly avoids his own death in the gunfight   later reuniting with Jim and the raft and together fleeing farther south on the Mississippi River. Further down the river   Jim and Huck rescue two cunning grifters   who join Huck and Jim on the raft. The younger of the two swindlers   a man of about thirty   introduces himself as a son of an English duke (the Duke of Bridgewater) and his father's rightful successor. The older one   about seventy   then trumps the Duke's claim by alleging that he is the Lost Dauphin   the son of Louis XVI and rightful King of France. He continually mispronounces the duke's title as ""Bilgewater"" in conversation. The Duke and the King then join Jim and Huck on the raft   committing a series of confidence schemes on the way south. To allow for Jim's presence   they print fake bills for an escaped slave; and later they paint him up entirely in blue and call him the ""Sick Arab"". On one occasion they arrive in a town and advertise a three-night engagement of a play which they call ""The Royal Nonesuch"". The play turns out to be only a couple of minutes of hysterical cavorting   not worth anywhere near the 50 cents the townsmen were charged to see it. On the afternoon of the first performance   a drunk called Boggs arrives in town and makes a nuisance of himself by going around threatening a southern gentleman by the name of Colonel Sherburn. Sherburn comes out and warns Boggs that he can continue threatening him up until exactly one o'clock. At one o'clock   Boggs continues and Colonel Sherburn kills him. Somebody in the crowd   whom Sherburn later identifies as Buck Harkness   cries out that Sherburn should be lynched. They all head up to Colonel Sherburn's gate   where they are met by Sherburn   who is standing on his porch carrying a loaded shotgun and his three legged dalmatian. He causes them to back down   by making a defiant speech telling them about the essential cowardice of ""Southern justice"". The only lynching to be done here   says Sherburn   will be in the dark   by men wearing masks. By the third night of ""The Royal Nonesuch""   the townspeople are ready to take their revenge; but the Duke and the King have already skipped town   and together with Huck and Jim   they continue down the river. Once they are far enough away   the two grifters test the next town   and decide to impersonate two brothers of Peter Wilks   a recently deceased man of property. Using an absurd English accent   the King manages to convince nearly all the townspeople that he is one of the brothers   a preacher just arrived from England   while the Duke pretends to be a deaf-mute to match accounts of the other brother. One man in town is certain that they are a fraud and confronts them on the matter   but the crowd refuses to support him. Afterwards   the Duke   out of fear   suggests to the King that they should cut and run. The King boldly states his intention to continue to liquidate Wilks' estate   saying   ""Hain't we got all the fools in town on our side? And ain't that a big enough majority in any town?"" Huck likes Wilks' daughters   who treat him with kindness and courtesy   so he tries to thwart the grifters' plans by stealing back the inheritance money. When he is in danger of being discovered   he has to hide it in Wilks' coffin   which is buried the next morning without Huck knowing whether the money has been found or not. The arrival of two new men who seem to be the real brothers throws everything into confusion when none of their signatures match the one on record. (The deaf-mute brother   who is said to do the correspondence   has his arm in a sling and cannot currently write.) The townspeople devise a test   which requires digging up the coffin to check. When the money is found in Wilks' coffin   the Duke and the King are able to escape in the confusion. They manage to rejoin Huck and Jim on the raft to Huck's despair   since he had thought he had escaped them. After the four fugitives have drifted far enough from the town   the King takes advantage of Huck's temporary absence to sell his interest in the ""escaped"" slave Jim for forty dollars. Outraged by this betrayal   Huck rejects the advice of his ""conscience""   which continues to tell him that in helping Jim escape to freedom   he is stealing Miss Watson's property. Accepting that-""All right   then   I'll go to hell!""-Huck resolves to free Jim. Jim is being held at the plantation of Silas and Sally Phelps. In a surprise twist   they are revealed to be Tom Sawyer's aunt and uncle. Since Tom is expected for a visit   Huck is mistaken for Tom. He plays along   hoping to find Jim's location and free him. When Huck intercepts Tom on the road and tells him everything   Tom decides to join Huck's scheme   pretending to be his own younger half-brother Sid. Jim has also told the household about the two grifters and the new plan for ""The Royal Nonesuch  "" so this time the townspeople are ready for them. The Duke and King are captured by the townspeople   and are tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail. Rather than simply sneaking Jim out of the shed where he is being held   Tom develops an elaborate plan to free him   involving secret messages   hidden tunnels   a rope ladder sent in Jim's food   and other elements from popular novels   including a note to the Phelps warning them of a gang planning to steal their runaway slave. During the resulting pursuit   Tom is shot in the leg. Jim remains with him rather than completing his escape   risking recapture. Huck has long known Jim was ""white on the inside"". Although the doctor admires Jim's decency   he betrays him to a passing skiff   and Jim is captured while sleeping and returned to the Phelps family. After Jim's recapture   events quickly resolve themselves. Tom's Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck and Tom's true identities. Tom announces that Jim is a free man; Miss Watson died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will   but Tom chose not to reveal Jim's freedom so he could come up with an elaborate plan to rescue Jim. Jim tells Huck that Huck's father has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found in the floating house) and that Huck may return safely to St. Petersburg. In the final narrative   Huck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story   and despite Sally's plans to adopt and ""civilize"" him   Huck intends to flee west to Indian Territory."  5

46  47  15055  Ivanhoe  Walter Scott  "{""/m/02p0szs"": ""Historical fiction""   ""/m/02xlf"": ""Fiction""   ""/m/0hwxm"": ""Historical novel""}"  " Wilfred of Ivanhoe is disinherited by his father Cedric of Rotherwood for supporting the Norman King Richard and for falling in love with the Lady Rowena   Cedric's ward and a descendant of the Saxon Kings of England. Cedric had planned to marry her to the powerful Lord Aethelstane   pretender to the Crown of England through his descent from the last Saxon King   Harold Godwinson   thus cementing a Saxon political alliance between two rivals for the same claim. Ivanhoe accompanies King Richard on the Crusades   where he is said to have played a notable role in the Siege of Acre. The book opens with a scene of Norman knights and prelates seeking the hospitality of Cedric. They are guided there by a palmer   who has recently returned from the Holy Land. The same night   seeking refuge from inclement weather and bandits   Isaac of York   a Jewish moneylender   arrives at Rotherwood. Following the night's meal   the palmer observes one of the Normans   the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert   issue orders to his Saracen soldiers to follow Isaac of York after he leaves Rotherwood in the morning and relieve him of his possessions. The palmer then warns the moneylender of his peril and assists in his escape from Rotherwood. The swineherd Gurth refuses to open the gates until the palmer whispers a few words in his ear   which turns Gurth as helpful as he was recalcitrant earlier. This is but one of the many mysterious incidents that occur throughout the book. Isaac of York offers to repay his debt to the palmer by offering him a suit of armour and a war horse to participate in the tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouch   where he was bound. His offer is made on the surmise that the palmer was in reality a knight   York having observed his knight's chain and spurs (a fact that he mentions to the palmer). The palmer is taken by surprise but accepts the offer. The story then moves to the scene of the tournament   which is presided over by Prince John   King Richard's younger brother. Other characters in attendance are Cedric   Aethelstane   Lady Rowena   Isaac of York   his daughter Rebecca   Robin of Locksley and his men   Prince John's advisor Waldemar Fitzurse   and numerous Norman knights. On the first day of the tournament   a bout of individual jousting   a mysterious masked knight   identifying himself only as ""Desdichado"" (which is described in the book as Spanish for the ""Disinherited One""   though actually meaning ""Unfortunate"")   makes his appearance and manages to defeat some of the best Norman lances   including Bois-Guilbert   Maurice de Bracy   a leader of a group of ""Free Companions"" (mercenary knights)   and the baron Reginald Front-de-Boeuf. The masked knight declines to reveal himself despite Prince John's request   but is nevertheless declared the champion of the day and is permitted to choose the Queen of the Tournament. He bestows this honour upon the Lady Rowena. On the second day   which is a melÃ©e   Desdichado is chosen to be leader of one party. Most of the leading knights of the realm   however   flock to the opposite standard under which Desdichado's vanquished opponents fought. Desdichado's side is soon hard pressed and he himself beset by multiple foes   when a knight who had until then taken no part in the battle   thus earning the sobriquet Le Noir Faineant (or the Black Sluggard)   rides to Desdichado's rescue. The rescuing knight   having evened the odds by his action   then slips away. Though Desdichado was instrumental in the victory   Prince John   being displeased with his behaviour of the previous day   wishes to bestow his accolades on the vanished Black Knight. Since the latter has departed   he is forced to declare Desdichado the champion. At this point   being forced to unmask himself to receive his coronet   Desdichado is revealed to be Wilfred of Ivanhoe himself   returned from the Crusades. This causes much consternation to Prince John and his court who now fear the imminent return of King Richard. Because he is severely wounded in the competition and because Cedric refuses to have anything to do with him   Ivanhoe is taken into the care of Rebecca   the beautiful daughter of Isaac   who is a skilled healer. She convinces her father to take him with them to York   where he may be best treated. The story then goes over the conclusion of the tournament including feats of archery by Locksley. Meanwhile   de Bracy finds himself infatuated with the Lady Rowena and   with his companions-in-arms   makes plans to abduct her. In the forests between Ashby and York   the Lady Rowena   Cedric   and Aethelstane encounter Isaac   Rebecca   and the wounded Ivanhoe   who had been abandoned by their servants for fear of bandits. The Lady Rowena   in response to the requests of Isaac and Rebecca   urges Cedric to take the group under his protection to York. Cedric   unaware that the wounded man is Ivanhoe   agrees. En route   the party is captured by de Bracy and his companions and taken to Torquilstone   the castle of Front-de-Boeuf. However   the swineherd Gurth   who had run away from Rotherwood to serve Ivanhoe as squire at the tournament and who was recaptured by Cedric when Ivanhoe was identified   manages to escape. The Black Knight   having taken refuge for the night in the hut of a local friar   the Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst   volunteers his assistance on learning about the captives from Robin of Locksley   who had come to rouse the friar for an attempt to free them. They then besiege the Castle of Torquilstone with Robin's own men   including the friar and assorted Saxon yeomen whom they had manage to raise due to the hatred of Front-de-Boeuf and his neighbour   Philip de Malvoisin. At Torquilstone   de Bracy expresses his love for the Lady Rowena   but is refused. In the meantime   de Bois-Guilbert   who had accompanied de Bracy on the raid   takes Rebecca for his captive   and tries to force his attentions on her   which are rebuffed. Front-de-Boeuf   in the meantime   tries to wring a hefty ransom   by torture   from Isaac of York. However   Isaac refuses to pay a farthing unless his daughter is freed from her Templar captor. When the besiegers deliver a note to yield up the captives   their Norman captors retort with a message for a priest to administer the Final Sacrament to the captives. It is then that Cedric's jester Wamba slips in disguised as a priest   and takes the place of Cedric   who then escapes and brings important information to the besiegers on the strength of the garrison and its layout. Then follows an account of the storming of the castle. Front-de-Boeuf is killed while de Bracy surrenders to the Black Knight   who identifies himself as King Richard. Showing mercy   he releases de Bracy. De Bois-Guilbert escapes with Rebecca while Isaac is released from his underground dungeon by the Clerk of Copmanhurst. The Lady Rowena is saved by Cedric   while the still-wounded Ivanhoe is rescued from the burning castle by King Richard. In the fighting   Aethelstane is wounded while attempting to rescue Rebecca   whom he mistakes for Rowena. Following the battle   Locksley plays host to King Richard. Word is also conveyed by de Bracy to Prince John of the King's return and the fall of Torquilstone. In the meantime   de Bois-Guilbert rushes with his captive to the nearest Templar Preceptory   which is under his friend Albert de Malvoisin   expecting to be able to flee the country. However   Lucas de Beaumanoir   the Grand-Master of the Templars is unexpectedly present there. He takes umbrage at de Bois-Guilbert's sinful passion   which is in violation of his Templar vows; and decides to subject Rebecca   who he thinks has cast a spell on de Bois-Guilbert   to a trial for witchcraft. She is found guilty through a flawed trial   but claims the right to trial by combat. Bois-Guilbert   who had hoped to fight as her champion incognito   is devastated when the Grand-Master orders him to fight against Rebecca's champion. Rebecca then writes to her father to procure a champion for her. Meanwhile Cedric organises Aethelstane's funeral at Coningsburgh   in the midst of which the Black Knight arrives with a companion. Cedric   who had not been present at Locksley's carousal   is ill-disposed towards the knight upon learning his true identity. However   King Richard calms Cedric and reconciles him with his son   convincing him to agree to the marriage of Ivanhoe and Rowena. Shortly after   Aethelstane emerges â not dead   but having been laid in his coffin alive by avaricious monks desirous of the funeral money. Over Cedric's renewed protests   Aethelstane pledges his homage to the Norman King Richard and urges Cedric to marry Rowena to Ivanhoe; to which Cedric finally agrees. Soon after this reconciliation   Ivanhoe receives word from Isaac beseeching him to fight on Rebecca's behalf. Upon arriving at the scene of the witch-burning   Ivanhoe forces de Bois-Guilbert from his saddle   but does not kill him. However   the Templar dies ""a victim to the violence of his own contending passions  "" which is pronounced by the Grand Master as the judgment of God and proof of Rebecca's innocence. King Richard   who had left Kyningestun soon after Ivanhoe's departure   arrives at the Templar Preceptory   banishes the Templars and declares that the Malvoisins' lives are forfeit for having aided in the plots against him. Fearing further persecution   Rebecca and her father leave England for Granada. Before leaving   Rebecca comes to bid Rowena a fond farewell. Finally   Ivanhoe and Rowena marry and live a long and happy life together   though the final paragraphs of the book note that Ivanhoe's long service ended with the death of King Richard."  18

The novel begins in Redmond as the characters are working on different projects at Microsoft's main campus. Life at the campus feels like a feudalistic society   with Bill Gates as the lord   and the employees the serfs. The majority of the main charactersâDaniel (the narrator)   Susan   Todd   Bug   Michael   and Abeâare living together in a ""geek house""   and their lives are dedicated to their projects and the company. Daniel's foundations are shaken when his father   a longtime employee of IBM   is laid off. The lifespan of a Microsoft coder weighs heavily on Daniel's mind. The second movement of the novel begins when the characters are offered jobs in Silicon Valley working on a project for Michael   who has by then left Redmond. All of the housematesâsome immediately   some after thoughtâdecide to move to the Valley. The characters' lives change drastically once they leave the limited sphere of the Microsoft campus and enter the world of ""One-Point-Oh"". They begin to work on a project called ""Oop!"" (a reference to object-oriented programming). Oop! is a Lego-like design program   allowing dynamic creation of many objects   bearing a resemblance to 2009's Minecraft. (Coupland appears on the rear cover of the novel's hardcover versions photographed in Denmark's Legoland Billund   holding a Lego 747.) One of the undercurrents of the plot is Daniel and his family's relationship to Jed   Daniel's younger brother who died in a boating accident while they were children."  17  "['Epistolary novel'   'Fiction']"  the plot of the novel has two distinct movements the events at microsoft and in redmond washington and the movement to silicon valley and the oop project the novel begins in redmond as the characters are working on different projects at microsofts main campus life at the campus feels like a feudalistic society with bill gates as the lord and the employees the serfs the majority of the main characters daniel the narrator susan todd bug michael and abe are living together in a geek house and their lives are dedicated to their projects and the company daniels foundations are shaken when his father a longtime employee of ibm is laid off the lifespan of a microsoft coder weighs heavily on daniels mind the second movement of the novel begins when the characters are offered jobs in silicon valley working on a project for michael who has by then left redmond all of the housemates some immediately some after thought decide to move to the valley the characters lives change drastically once they leave the limited sphere of the microsoft campus and enter the world of one point oh they begin to work on a project called oop a reference to object oriented programming oop is a lego like design program allowing dynamic creation of many objects bearing a resemblance to s minecraft coupland appears on the rear cover of the novels hardcover versions photographed in denmarks legoland billund holding a lego one of the undercurrents of the plot is daniel and his familys relationship to jed daniels younger brother who died in a boating accident while they were children  Epistolary novel Fiction  the plot of the novel has two distinct movements the events at microsoft and in redmond washington and the movement to silicon valley and the oop project the novel begins in redmond as the characters are working on different projects at microsofts main campus life at the campus feels like a feudalistic society with bill gates as the lord and the employees the serfs the majority of the main characters daniel the narrator susan todd bug michael and abe are living together in a geek house and their lives are dedicated to their projects and the company daniels foundations are shaken when his father a longtime employee of ibm is laid off the lifespan of a microsoft coder weighs heavily on daniels mind the second movement of the novel begins when the characters are offered jobs in silicon valley working on a project for michael who has by then left redmond all of the housemates some immediately some after thought decide to move to the valley the characters lives change drastically once they leave the limited sphere of the microsoft campus and enter the world of one point oh they begin to work on a project called oop a reference to object oriented programming oop is a lego like design program allowing dynamic creation of many objects bearing a resemblance to s minecraft coupland appears on the rear cover of the novels hardcover versions photographed in denmarks legoland billund holding a lego one of the undercurrents of the plot is daniel and his familys relationship to jed daniels younger brother who died in a boating accident while they were children Douglas Coupland Epistolary novel Fiction
53  54  19859  "Moby-Dick; or   The Whale"  Herman Melville  "{""/m/07m5w1"": ""Sea story""   ""/m/02xlf"": ""Fiction""   ""/m/08sdrw"": ""Adventure novel""}"  " ""Moby-Dick"" begins with the line ""Call me Ishmael."" According to the American Book Review's rating in 2011   this is one of the most recognizable opening lines in Western literature. The narrator   an observant young man setting out from Manhattan   has experience in the merchant marine but has recently decided his next voyage will be on a whaling ship. On a cold   gloomy night in December   he arrives at the Spouter-Inn in New Bedford   Massachusetts   and agrees to share a bed with a then-absent stranger. When his bunk mate   a heavily tattooed Polynesian harpooner named Queequeg   returns very late and discovers Ishmael beneath his covers   both men are alarmed   but the two quickly become close friends and decide to sail together from Nantucket   Massachusetts on a whaling voyage. In Nantucket   the pair signs on with the Pequod   a whaling ship that is soon to leave port. The shipâs captain   Ahab   is nowhere to be seen; nevertheless   they are told of him&nbsp;â a ""grand   ungodly   godlike man  "" who has ""been in colleges as well as 'mong the cannibals  "" according to one of the owners. The two friends encounter a mysterious man named Elijah on the dock after they sign their papers and he hints at troubles to come with Ahab. The mystery grows on Christmas morning when Ishmael spots dark figures in the mist   apparently boarding the Pequod shortly before it sets sail that day. The shipâs officers direct the early voyage while Ahab stays in his cabin. The chief mate is Starbuck   a serious   sincere Quaker and fine leader; second mate is Stubb   happy-go-lucky and cheerful and always smoking his pipe; the third mate is Flask   short and stout but thoroughly reliable. Each mate is responsible for a whaling boat   and each whaling boat of the Pequod has its own pagan harpooneer assigned to it. Some time after sailing   Ahab finally appears on the quarter-deck one morning   an imposing   frightening figure whose haunted visage sends shivers over the narrator. One of his legs is missing from the knee down and has been replaced by a prosthesis fashioned from a sperm whale's jawbone. Soon gathering the crewmen together   with a rousing speech Ahab secures their support for his single   secret purpose for this voyage: hunting down and killing Moby Dick   an old   very large sperm whale   with a snow-white hump and mottled skin   that crippled Ahab on his last whaling voyage. Only Starbuck shows any sign of resistance to the charismatic but monomaniacal captain. The first mate argues repeatedly that the shipâs purpose should be to hunt whales for their oil   with luck returning home profitably   safely   and quickly   but not to seek out and kill Moby Dick in particular&nbsp;â and especially not for revenge. Eventually even Starbuck acquiesces to Ahab's will   though harboring misgivings. The mystery of the dark figures seen before the Pequod set sail is explained during the voyage's first lowering for whales. Ahab has secretly brought along his own boat crew   including a mysterious harpooneer named Fedallah (also referred to as 'the Parsee')   an inscrutable figure with a sinister influence over Ahab. Later   while watching one night over a captured whale carcass   Fedallah gives dark prophecies to Ahab regarding their twin deaths. The novel describes numerous ""gams  "" social meetings of two ships on the open sea. Crews normally visit each other during a gam   captains on one vessel and chief mates on the other. Mail may be exchanged and the men talk of whale sightings or other news. For Ahab   however   there is but one relevant question to ask of another ship: âHast seen the White Whale?â After meeting several other whaling ships   which have their own peculiar stories   the Pequod enters the Pacific Ocean. Queequeg becomes deathly ill and requests that a coffin be built for him by the shipâs carpenter. Just as everyone has given up hope   Queequeg changes his mind   deciding to live after all   and recovers quickly. His coffin becomes his sea chest   and is later caulked and pitched to replace the Pequods life buoy. Soon word is heard from other whalers of Moby Dick. The jolly Captain Boomer of the Samuel Enderby has lost an arm to the whale   and is stunned at Ahab's burning need for revenge. Next they meet the Rachel   which has seen Moby Dick very recently. As a result of the encounter   one of its boats is missing; the captainâs youngest son had been aboard. The Rachels captain begs Ahab to aid in the search for the missing boat   but Ahab is resolute; the Pequod is very near the White Whale now and will not stop to help. Finally the Delight is met   even as its captain buries a sailor who had been killed by Moby Dick. Starbuck begs Ahab one final time to reconsider his thirst for vengeance   but to no avail. The next day   the Pequod meets Moby Dick. For two days   the Pequods crew pursues the whale   which wreaks widespread destruction   including the disappearance of Fedallah. On the third day   Moby Dick rises up to reveal Fedallah's corpse tied to him by harpoon ropes. Even after the initial battle on the third day   it is clear that while Ahab is a vengeful whale-hunter   Moby Dick   while dangerous and fearless   is not motivated to hunt humans. As he swims away from the Pequod   Starbuck exhorts Ahab one last time to desist   observing that: Ahab ignores this voice of reason and continues with his ill-fated chase. As the three boats sail out to hunt him   Moby Dick damages two of them   forcing them to go back to the ship and leaving only Ahab's vessel intact. Ahab harpoons the whale   but the harpoon-line breaks. Moby Dick then rams the Pequod itself   which begins to sink. As Ahab harpoons the whale again   the unfolding harpoon-line catches him around his neck and he is dragged into the depths of the sea by the diving Moby Dick. The boat is caught up in the whirlpool of the sinking ship   which takes almost all the crew to their deaths. Only Ishmael survives   clinging to Queequegâs coffin-turned-life buoy for an entire day and night before the Rachel rescues him."  17  "['Sea story'   'Fiction'   'Adventure novel']"  moby dick

54  55  20361  Moonfleet  J. Meade Falkner  "{""/m/08sdrw"": ""Adventure novel""}"  " In 1757   Moonfleet is a small village near the sea in the south of England. It gets its name from a formerly prominent local family   the Mohunes   whose coat of arms included a symbol shaped like a capital 'Y'. John Trenchard is an orphan who lives with his aunt   Miss Arnold. Other notable residents are the sexton Mr Ratsey who is friendly to John   Parson Glennie   the local clergyman who also teaches in the village school   Elzevir Block   the landlord of the local inn   called the Mohune Arms but nicknamed the Why Not? because of its sign with the Mohune 'Y'   and Mr Maskew   the unpopular local magistrate and his beautiful daughter   Grace. Village legend tells of the notorious Colonel John ""Blackbeard"" Mohune who is buried in the family crypt under the church. He is reputed to have stolen a diamond from King Charles I and hidden it. His ghost is said to wander at night looking for it and the mysterious lights in the churchyard are attributed to his activities. As the main part of the story opens   Block's youthful son   David   has just been killed by Maskew during an attack by the authorities on a smuggling boat. One night a bad storm hits the village and there is a flood. While attending the Sunday service at church   John hears strange sounds from the crypt below. He thinks it is the sound of the coffins of the Mohune family. The next day   he finds Elzevir and Ratsey against the south wall of the church. They claim to be checking for damage from the storm   but John suspects they are searching for Blackbeard's ghost. Later John finds a large sinkhole has opened in the ground by a grave. He follows the passage and finds himself in the crypt with coffins on shelves and casks on the floor. He realises his friends are smugglers and this is their hiding place. He has to hide behind a coffin when he hears Ratsey and Elzevir coming. When they leave   they fill in the hole   inadvertently trapping him. John finds a locket in a coffin which holds a piece of paper with verses from the Bible. John eventually passes out after drinking too much of the wine while trying to quench his thirst   having not eaten or drunk for days. Later he wakes up in the Why Not? Inn- he has been rescued by Elzevir and Ratsey. When he is better   he returns to his Aunt's house   but she   suspecting him of drunken behaviour   throws him out. Fortunately   Elzevir takes him in. But when Block's lease on the Why Not? comes up for renewal   Maskew bids against him in the auction and wins. Block must leave the inn and Moonfleet but plans one last smuggling venture. John feels honour-bound to go with him   and sadly   says goodbye to Grace Maskew   whom he loves and has been seeing in secret   and gets his mother's prayer book as a good luck charm. The excisemen and Maskew are aware of the planned smuggling run but do not know exactly where it will occur. During the landing Maskew appears and is caught by the smugglers. Elzevir is bent on vengeance for his son by killing Maskew   and while the rest land the cargo and leave   he and John keep watch over Maskew. Just as Block prepares to shoot Maskew the excisemen attack. They kill Maskew and wound John. Block carries John away to safety and they hide in some old quarries. While there   John inadvertently finds out that the verses from Blackbeard's locket contain a code which will reveal the location of his famous diamond. Once John's wound heals   he and Block decide to recover the diamond from Carisbrooke Castle. After a suspenseful scene in the well where the jewel is hidden   they succeed and escape to Holland where they try to sell it to a Jewish diamond merchant named Crispin Aldobrand. The merchant cheats them   claiming the diamond is fake. Elzevir falls for the deceit and angrily throws the diamond out of the window. John   however   knows they have been duped   and suggests they try to recover the diamond through burglary. The attempt fails and   they are arrested and sentenced to prison. John curses the merchant for his lies. John and Elzevir go to prison for life. Eventually they are separated. Then   unexpectedly   ten years later   their paths cross again. They are being transported   and board a ship. A storm blows up   and by a strong coincidence   John and Elzevir find themselves near Moonfleet. They throw themselves into the sea and start to swim to shore. Elzevir helps John to safety   but is himself dragged under by the tide and drowned. So John ends up back where his whole adventure started   in the Why Not?   and is reunited with Ratsy. He is also reunited with Grace. She is now a rich young lady   having inherited her father's money. However   she is still in love with John   and they decide to marry. John tells her about the diamond and his life in prison. He regrets having lost everything   but then Parson Glennie receives a letter from Aldobrand. The merchant suffered a guilty conscience   and in an attempt to make amends   has bequeathed the worth of the diamond to John. John gives the money to the village   and new almshouses are built   and the school and the church renovated. John marries Grace and becomes Lord of the Manor and Justice of the Peace. Their three children grow up and their sons leave home   including their first-born son   Elzevir. But John and Grace themselves have no plans to leave their beloved Moonfleet ever again. A feature of the narrative is a continuing reference to the boardgame of backgammon which is played by the patrons of the Why Not? on an antique board which bears a Latin inscription Ita in vita ut in lusu alae pessima jactura arte corrigenda est (translated in the book as As in life   so in a game of hazard   skill will make something of the worst of throws).

Once a talented computer hacker   Case was caught stealing from his employer. As punishment for his theft   Case's central nervous system was damaged with a mycotoxin   leaving him unable to use keyboard skills to access the global computer network in cyberspace   a virtual reality dataspace called the ""Matrix"". Unemployable   addicted to drugs   and suicidal   Case desperately searches the Chiba ""black clinics"" for a miracle cure. Case is saved by Molly Millions   an augmented ""street samurai"" and mercenary for a shadowy ex-military officer named Armitage   who offers to cure Case in exchange for his services as a hacker. Case jumps at the chance to regain his life as a ""console cowboy  "" but neither Case nor Molly know what Armitage is really planning. Case's nervous system is repaired using new technology that Armitage offers the clinic as payment   but he soon learns from Armitage that sacs of the poison that first crippled him have been placed in his blood vessels as well. Armitage promises Case that if he completes his work in time   the sacs will be removed; otherwise they will dissolve   disabling him again. He also has Case's pancreas replaced and new tissue grafted into his liver   leaving Case incapable of metabolizing cocaine or amphetamines and apparently ending his drug addiction. Case develops a close personal relationship with Molly   who suggests that he begin looking into Armitage's background. Meanwhile   Armitage assigns them their first job: they must steal a ROM module that contains the saved consciousness of one of Case's mentors   legendary cyber-cowboy McCoy Pauley   nicknamed ""Dixie Flatline."" Pauley's hacking expertise is needed by Armitage   and the ROM construct is stored in the corporate headquarters of media conglomerate Sense/Net. A street gang named the ""Panther Moderns"" are hired to create a simulated terrorist attack on Sense/Net. The diversion allows Molly to penetrate the building and steal Dixie's ROM. Case and Molly continue to investigate Armitage   discovering his former identity of Colonel Willis Corto. Corto was a member of ""Operation Screaming Fist  "" which planned on infiltrating and disrupting Soviet computer systems from ultralight aircraft dropped over Russia. The Russian military had learned of the idea and installed defenses to render the attack impossible   but the military went ahead with Screaming Fist   with a new secret purpose of testing these Russian defenses. As the Operation team attacked a Soviet computer center   EMP weapons shut down their computers and flight systems   and Corto and his men were targeted by Soviet laser defenses. He and a few survivors commandeered a Soviet military helicopter and escaped over the heavily guarded Finnish border. Everyone was killed except Corto   who was seriously wounded and heavily mutilated by Finnish defense forces attacking as they were landing the helicopter. Corto after some months in hospital is visited by a Government military official and then medically rebuilt to be able to provide what he came to realise was fake testimony   designed to mislead the public and protect the military officers who had covered up knowledge of the EMP weapons. After the trials   Corto snaps   killing the Government official who contacted him and then disappears into the criminal underworld. In Istanbul   the team recruits Peter Riviera   an artist   thief   and drug addict who is able to project detailed holographic illusions with the aid of sophisticated cybernetic implants. Although Riviera is a sociopath   Armitage coerces him into joining the team. The trail leads Case and Molly to a powerful artificial intelligence named Wintermute   created by the plutocratic Tessier-Ashpool family   who spend most of their inactive time in cryonic preservation inside Villa Straylight   a labyrinthine mansion located at one end of Freeside   a cylindrical space habitat located at L5   and functioning primarily as a Las Vegas-style space resort for the wealthy. Wintermute's nature is finally revealed â it is one-half of a super-AI entity planned by the family   although its exact purpose is unknown. The Turing Law Code governing AIs bans the construction of such entities; to get around this   it had to be built as two separate AIs. Wintermute was programmed by the Tessier-Ashpool dynasty with a need to merge with its other half â Neuromancer. Unable to achieve this merger on its own   Wintermute recruited Armitage and his team to help complete the goal. Case is tasked with entering cyberspace to pierce the Turing-imposed software barriers using a powerful icebreaker program. At the same time   Riviera is to obtain the password to the Turing lock from Lady 3Jane Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool   an unfrozen daughter clone and the current leader of Tessier-Ashpool SA. Wintermute believes Riviera will pose an irresistible temptation to her   and that she will give him the password. The password must be spoken into an ornate computer terminal located in the Tessier-Ashpool home in Villa Straylight   and entered simultaneously as Case pierces the software barriers in cyberspace â otherwise the Turing lock will remain intact. Armitage's team attracts the attention of the Turing Police   whose job is to prevent AIs from exceeding their built-in limitations. As Molly and Riviera gain entrance to Villa Straylight   three officers arrest Case and take him into custody; Wintermute manipulates the orbital casino's security and maintenance systems and kills the officers   allowing Case to escape. The Armitage personality starts to disintegrate and revert to the Corto personality as he relives Screaming Fist. It is revealed that in the past   Wintermute had originally contacted Corto through a bedside computer during his convalescence   eventually convincing Corto that he was Armitage. Wintermute used him to persuade Case and Molly to help it merge with its twin AI   Neuromancer. Finally   Armitage becomes the shattered Corto again   but his newfound personality is short-lived as he is killed by Wintermute. Inside Villa Straylight   Molly is captured by Riviera and Lady 3Jane. Worried about Molly and operating under orders from Wintermute   Case tracks her down with help from Maelcum   his Rastafarian pilot. Neuromancer attempts to trap Case within a cyber-construct where he finds the consciousness of Linda Lee   his girlfriend from Chiba City   who was murdered by one of Case's underworld contacts. Case manages to escape flatlining inside the construct by choosing of his own free will not to stay. Freeing himself   Case takes Maelcum and confronts Lady 3Jane   Riviera   and Hideo   Lady 3Jane's ninja bodyguard. Riviera tries to kill Case   but Lady 3Jane is sympathetic towards Case and Molly   and Hideo protects him. Riviera blinds Hideo   but flees when he learns that the ninja is just as adept without his sight. Molly then explains to Case that Riviera is doomed anyway   as he has been fatally poisoned by his drugs   which she had spiked. With Lady 3Jane in possession of the password   the team makes it to the computer terminal. Case ascends to cyberspace to guide the icebreaker to penetrate its target; Lady 3Jane is induced to give up her password and the lock is opened. Wintermute unites with Neuromancer   fusing into a greater entity. The poison in Case's bloodstream is washed out   and he and Molly are handsomely paid for their efforts   while Pauley's ROM construct is apparently erased   at his own request. In the epilogue   Molly leaves Case. Case finds a new girlfriend   resumes his hacking work   and spends his earnings from the mission replacing his internal organs so that he can continue his previous drug use. Wintermute/Neuromancer contacts him   saying that it has become ""the sum total of the works   the whole show  "" and has begun looking for other AIs like itself. Scanning old recorded transmissions from the 1970s   the super-AI finds a lone AI transmitting from the Alpha Centauri star system. In the matrix   Case hears inhuman laughter   a trait associated with Pauley during Case's work with his ROM construct   thus suggesting that Pauley was not erased after all   but instead worked out a side deal with Wintermute/Neuromancer to be freed from the construct so he could exist in the matrix. In the end   while logged into the matrix   Case catches a glimpse of himself   his dead girlfriend Linda Lee   and Neuromancer. The implication of the sighting is that Neuromancer created a copy of Case's consciousness when it previously tried to trap him. The copy of Case's consciousness now exists with that of Linda's   in the matrix   where they are together forever."  16  "['Cyberpunk'   'Science Fiction'   'Speculative fiction'   'Dystopia']"

In 1942   Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse   a young U.S. Navy code breaker and mathematical genius   is assigned to the newly formed joint British and American Detachment 2702. This ultra-secret unit's role is to hide the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the German Enigma code. The detachment stages events   often behind enemy lines   that provide alternative explanations for the Allied intelligence successes. Marine sergeant Bobby Shaftoe   a veteran of China and Guadalcanal   serves in unit 2702   carrying out Waterhouse's plans. At the same time   Japanese soldiers including mining engineer Goto Dengo   an old friend of Shaftoe's   are assigned to build a mysterious bunker in the mountains in the Philippines as part of what turns out to be a literal suicide mission. Circa 1997   Randy Waterhouse (Lawrence's grandson) joins his old Dungeons and Dragons companion Avi Halaby in a new startup   providing Pinoy-grams to migrant Filipinos via new fiber-optic cables. The aptly named Epiphyte Corporation uses this income stream to fund the creation of a data haven in the nearby fictional Sultanate of Kinakuta. Vietnam veteran Doug Shaftoe and his daughter Amy do the undersea surveying for the cables and engineering work on the haven is overseen by Goto Furudenendu   heir-apparent to Goto Engineering.
